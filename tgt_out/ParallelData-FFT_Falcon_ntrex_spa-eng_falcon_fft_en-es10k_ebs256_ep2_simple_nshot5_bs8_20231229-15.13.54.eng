The Members of the Welsh Assembly (AM, for its English initials) are concerned that they may appear "muppets".
Some Members of the Assembly are confused by the suggestion that their title should be changed to Members of the Welsh Parliament (MWP, for its English initials).
This confusion arises from the plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the whole political spectrum are concerned that this could be ridiculed.
A Labour Party Member of Parliament said that his group was concerned that "it would end up with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: Twp means "idiot" and pwp means "shit".
A Member of the Welsh Assembly said that his group was "disappointed" and had suggested alternatives.
A Conservative Party member in Wales said his group was "open" to a name change, but noted that the jump from MWP to muppet was "small".
In this context, the pronunciation of the Welsh letter w is similar to the pronunciation of the English letter u in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce name changes, states: "Of course, the final decision on any descriptive element of the name of Assembly members will be a matter for the Assembly members themselves."
The 2017 Government of Wales Act gave the Assembly of Wales the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which revealed strong support for calling the Welsh Parliament to the Assembly.
On the issue of the title of Members of the Assembly, the Committee preferred Members of Parliament of Wales (or WMP), but the option MWP received the majority of support in a public consultation.
It appears that Assembly Members are suggesting alternatives, but the fight for consensus could stall the Assembly President, Elin Jones, who would have to send the bill for the changes through in a few weeks.
The legislation on reform will include other changes related to the operation of the Assembly, such as rules on the disqualification of Members and the design of the committee system.
The Assembly will have the final say on how the names should be called when it deliberates on legislation.
Macedonians go to the polls to vote on a referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will decide on Sunday whether their country will be renamed "Republic of Northern Macedonia".
The popular vote was called in an attempt to resolve a decades-old conflict with the neighbouring country, Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has always insisted that its northern neighbour's name implies a claim to its territory and has repeatedly opposed its membership of the EU and NATO.
Macedonia &apos; s President, Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the name-change referendum, has said he will ignore the vote.
However, the proponents of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin &apos; s Church are silent in Harlem
Historically, the people I have spoken to say that there was a bar and a church on every corner.
Today, there is neither one nor the other.
It was understandable that bars were disappearing.
Now people socialize in different ways, he says.
"Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighbourhoods that people visit regularly."
With regard to churches, he is concerned that the money raised from the sale of assets will not last as long as church leaders hope, and that "at some point, they will have to go back to square one."
He added that churches could be replaced by apartment buildings full of the kind of people who would not help the remaining shrines in the neighbourhood.
“The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white people, and therefore they will accelerate the closing of these churches, as it is unlikely that the majority of people who move into these apartments will be members of these churches.”
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis: Metropolitan Community Church in 1870 and St. Martin &apos; s in 1880.
The original white Methodist congregation disappeared in the 1930s.
A black congregation that worshipped in the building acquired it.
A black congregation took over St. Martin's, under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of the merchants on 125th Street, a main shopping street in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote black employees.
In 1939, a fire left the building severely damaged, and while the congregation of Father Johnson was planning for its reconstruction, they also ordered the pulpit.
The Reverend David Johnson, son and successor of Father Johnson in San Martin, called them "the poor man's campaigns."
In July, the expert playing the bell called it a "cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
In addition, Tiffany Ng, an expert from the University of Michigan, noted that it was the first drumline in the world used by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who went on to play the Riverside Church drumline, a larger drumline, 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that San Martin did not replace him.
What has happened in San Martin in the last few months has been a complicated story of architects and contractors, some brought in by the lay leaders of the church and others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The parish council, the parish governing body, composed of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July expressing concern that the diocese was attempting to pass the costs to the parish council, even though it had not been involved in the hiring of the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Tiger shark injures 13-year-old boy diving for abalone in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while he was diving for abalone in California on the opening day of the abalone season, according to authorities.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about 30 minutes on Saturday morning when he heard the child calling for help, so he swam over with a group to rescue him from the water.
Hammel said he initially thought he was just excited about having caught a lobster, but then realized he was "screaming that he had been bitten."
The boy had a broken collarbone, Hammel observed as he approached the child.
Hammel said, "I told everyone to get out of the water because there was a shark."
The child was transported by helicopter to the Rady Children &apos; s Hospital, where he is in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
The rescue swimmer, Captain Larry Giles, said at a press conference that a shark had been spotted in the area about a week earlier, but that it was not considered a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim had upper torso injuries.
The authorities closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Carlsbad to Swami s Beach in Encinitas for 48 hours to investigate and for security reasons.
Giles noted that there were more than 135 shark species in the area, but that most were not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's beauty plans drive the UK beauty market
Sainsbury &apos; s buys Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, which have many specialist staff working in the aisles of their style and beauty stores.
In order to significantly boost the beauty market in the UK, valued at £28 billion and growing faster than the decline in fashion and homewares sales, the largest beauty halls in 11 stores across the country will be trialled this year, with a view to rolling out to more stores next year.
The investment in beauty comes at the same time as this chain of supermarkets is looking for ways to use the space in shelves that used to be used for televisions, microwaves and home appliances.
Sainsbury's said it would double its beauty offer with up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
In addition, there will be more space for existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees brands, with similar-looking areas to those in other stores, such as Boots.
The chain will also relaunch its Boutique makeup range, with a majority of animal-friendly products, something increasingly demanded by younger customers.
The Fragrance Shop will also be trialling its concessions in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, south London, last week, and the second of which will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and the move towards daily small-quantity food shopping in local stores are forcing supermarkets to work harder to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, the chief executive of Sainsbury's, has said that supermarkets will become more like shopping centres as the chain tries to fight off Aldi and Lidl by offering more non-food products and services.
Sainsbury's has integrated Argos discount points into hundreds of stores and introduced several Habitat stores since it acquired these chains two years ago. It is believed that this has driven food sales and made these acquisitions profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket chain to revamp its beauty and pharmacy departments was a failure.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership ended after a disagreement over how to split the profits from the drugstore products in its supermarkets.
The new strategy follows the sale of 281 Sainsbury &apos; s pharmaceutical establishments to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million three years ago.
It is noted that Lloyds will be participating in the plan, adding an expanded range of luxury skin care brands, such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
As Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director at Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty aisles to enhance the environment for our customers."
We have also invested in a specialized staff that will be available to provide advice.
Our offer of brands is designed to meet all needs. On the other hand, an attractive environment and a convenient location make us an irresistible beauty destination, challenging the old way of buying.
Peter Jones is "furious" after Holly Willoughby breaks a £11m deal
Dragon's Den star Peter Jones was "furious" after Holly Willoughby broke a £11m deal with his lifestyle business to focus on new contracts with Marks &amp; Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for fashion and accessories Truly.
This business had been compared to Goop by Gwyneth Paltrow.
This Morning presenter Holly Willoughby, 37, announced she was leaving the business on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has infuriated Dragon's Den star Peter Jones by quitting her lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute to focus on her extraordinary new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources consulted, Jones was "furious" when the girl of gold from television admitted that her new deals, worth up to £1.5 million, left no time for her Truly fashion and accessories brand.
The business had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow &apos; s Goop and was being touted as a favourite to double Willoughby &apos; s fortune, which was estimated at £11 million.
While Willoughby, 37, announced he was leaving the business on Instagram, Jones was leaving Britain to go to one of his holiday homes.
As one source put it: "Holly truly was, by far, the number one priority of Holly."
It was going to be her long-term future, which would keep her going for the next two decades.
His decision to leave left everyone involved completely stunned.
Nobody could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to launch.
There is a warehouse full of goods at Marlow HQ, ready to go on sale.
Experts believe the departure of the presenter of This Morning, one of Britain's most valuable stars, could cost millions to the company due to the significant investment in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothing, and possibly delay the launch even further.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, are parents of three children and have been close friends of Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for 10 years.
Willoughby founded Truly in 2016 with Capp and Jones, 52, joined as president in March.
The couple were on holiday together and Jones had a 40 per cent stake in Baldwin &apos; s television production company.
Willoughby is to become the face of Marks & Spencer and will replace Ant McPartlin as presenter of ITV &apos; s I &apos; m A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said that last night "we didn't talk about business."
A difficult conversation &quot; and then we fell in love &quot;
He joked about the criticism he received from the media for making a comment that some might consider "not presidential" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so many things?
Trump spoke in his mock-newsman voice.
I have not given up.
He said Kim was interested in meeting him again after Trump had praised the first meeting held in June in Singapore, which he saw as a big step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations for nuclear disarmament have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, the North Korean chief diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told the world leaders gathered at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that his country had not seen an "appropriate response" from the United States to the first steps towards disarmament of North Korea.
In contrast, the United States continues to impose sanctions in order to maintain pressure.
Trump's speech was much more optimistic than the one he gave at his rally.
We get along great with North Korea, he said.
We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions would have died.
Now we have a fantastic relationship.
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim had produced positive results: the end of missile tests, help for the release of hostages and the return of the remains of American soldiers home.
He also defended his unusual approach to talking about relations with Kim.
It is very easy to be president, but then, instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into this full stadium, we would have 200 people right here.
A tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastate an island, leaving hundreds dead
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok had been displaced, no national emergency had been declared, a prerequisite for international assistance to be activated.
Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it clear that they do not want international assistance, which complicates things a bit.
Save the Children is preparing a team to go to Palu, but they are still unsure whether foreign staff can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, the national disaster agency spokesman, said that the authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international organizations could provide assistance.
Given that Indonesia is a country where the earth is constantly moving, the country is still woefully unprepared when nature unleashes its fury.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not as common in other coastal areas.
It is likely that the apparent lack of tsunami warning sirens in Palu, even if there was a warning in advance, contributed to the loss of lives.
In the best of cases, travelling from one Indonesian island to another is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship in Lombok to treat the victims of the earthquake is heading to Palu, but will take at least three days to reach the new disaster zone.
President Joko Widodo has made the improvement of Indonesia &apos; s worn-out infrastructure the central focus of his election campaign, and has allocated a lot of money to roads and railways.
However, the lack of funding has affected the management of Mr Joko, who is facing re-election next year.
He must also contend with the persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people died and tens of thousands had to flee their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets using machetes, bows and arrows, and other rudimentary weapons.
Look at this: Daniel Sturridge, of Liverpool, scores against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge rescued Liverpool from defeat in the Premier League with a late goal against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday.
Sturridge received a Shaqiri pass from 27 metres out to score the equaliser for Chelsea against Manchester City.
He kicked the ball with his left foot before sending it to the second post.
The action took him over the area and headed towards the top right corner of the network.
Finally, the ball went over Kepa Arrizabalaga, who tried to stop it with a leap and fell into the net.
“I was trying to get myself into that position to get the ball and the players like Shaq always play very advanced, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible,” said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante coming and gave him a nudge. I didn't think too much about it, I just fired.
Chelsea were 1-0 up at half-time after Belgium star Eden Hazard had scored in the 25th minute.
The Blues' midfield pivot, Mateo Kovacic, made a step-over pass to Mateo Kovacic in that play, before turning and dribbling into the Liverpool half and entering the field.
Kovacic quickly passed the ball and ran into the middle of the field.
Then he did a nice little spacewalk that took him to the area.
Hazard was in front of the defence and finished with a left-footed shot from the edge of the area that Becker, of Liverpool, could not stop.
Wednesday, 15:00, Liverpool plays against Napoli in the Champions League group stage. The match will be held at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea, meanwhile, faces Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 15:00 GMT in London.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia rises to 832
The number of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, as reported by the Indonesian disaster agency at 1 a.m. on Sunday.
Many people were trapped in the rubble of buildings that collapsed during the magnitude 7.5 earthquake that struck on Friday, which triggered waves of up to six metres, according to Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency, during a press briefing.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with debris from the collapsed buildings.
A 32-year-old man is arrested by police as a suspect in the murder of a woman stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
A 44-year-old woman was found with stab wounds at Grayson Mews, John Street, at 7.55 a.m. and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police have urged people in the area who have seen or heard anything to contact the police.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in its early stages, but I would encourage anyone who was in the vicinity of John Street, in Birkenhead, and who saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us."
I would also recommend anyone who may have seen something on dashcam to contact us, as they may have vital information for our investigation.”
A Police spokesman has confirmed that the body of a woman found is that of a woman from Birkenhead and that she was found inside a property.
Some people who believed they knew the woman arrived at the crime scene this afternoon to find out where she had been found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and the police have reported that they are in the process of informing the family of the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has tried to get back into his flat, but the police tell him that no one can enter or leave the building.
He was left dumbfounded when he discovered what had happened.
Now, residents are being told that they will be allowed back in within a few hours.
Someone heard an agent tell a man that the entire area was being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared in tears.
He keeps saying "it's terrible".
At 2 p.m., there were two police vans inside the cordon and one more outside.
Several agents were standing guard inside the cordon, monitoring the building.
Any person with information should contact Merseyside Police on 101, Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, or register 247 on 30 September.
Cromwell statue in Parliament becomes the last successful commemorative project by "rewriting history"
Its prohibition would be poetic justice for this Taliban-style destruction of so many cultural and religious objects and sites in England carried out by its fanatical Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described Mr Crick &apos; s suggestions as &quot; crazy &quot; and an attempt to &quot; rewrite history &quot;.
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable that the removal of the statue of Oliver Cromwell from Westminster Palace would become a target."
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was not ordered or carried out by Cromwell.
It may be that the wrong Cromwell is sacrificed to the actions of his ancestor, Thomas, a century earlier.
The magnificent portrait of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft Cromwell by Sir Thomas Lawrence is a testament to the opinion of the 19th century and to the history of a figure that many consider worthy of celebration.
As Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many people see Cromwell, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as a defender of Parliament against external pressure, in this case, the monarchy."
If it is a completely accurate description, then it is a matter for historical debate.
What is true is that the mid-seventeenth-century conflict has shaped the later development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure that represents one side of that division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and commemoration.
A Chinese pig farmer is attacked by a killer pig
A pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southwest China, according to local media.
The man, identified only by his surname Yuan, was found dead with an artery severed and covered in blood near a pigsty in Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, as reported by the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject pigs with vaccines in a pen in Xining, Qinghai Province, China, on 30 May 2005.
It seems that he travelled with his cousin from the neighbouring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that a nearby pigsty door was open.
He said there was a big pig with blood on its mouth in the pen.
The autopsy confirmed that the pig had attacked the farmer to death, according to the report.
His legs were bloodied and mangled, his cousin said, to The Guiyang Evening News.
The security camera images showed Yuan entering the market on Thursday at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found approximately one hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not Yuan's or his cousin's.
A market manager told The Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking anyone else, while police were collecting evidence at the scene.
It appears that Yuan's family and the market authorities are negotiating a settlement for his death.
Although they are rare, this is not the first time a pig has attacked a person.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man seriously injured.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing almost 295 kilograms cornered a farmer in his tractor until his wife scared it away.
After pigs ate a rancher in Oregon in 2012, a Manitoba rancher told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a "dispenser."
They are just playing.
They are like children, very curious - their intention is not to hurt.
What we need to do is to treat them with the respect they deserve,” he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will bring widespread heavy rain to the southwest of the United States.
As expected, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the cooler waters of the north Mexico coast.
However, Rosa will bring torrential rains to the north of Mexico and the south-west of the United States in the next few days.
Hurricane Rosa produced gusts of wind of more than 136 km/h, a category 1 hurricane, from Sunday morning (Eastern Standard Time) to Monday morning (Eastern Daylight Time), and was located about 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia (Mexico).
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, low pressure systems are starting to form in the Pacific Ocean, moving eastward towards the West Coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday, a tropical storm will begin to push the intense tropical rainfall northward towards the south-eastern United States.
Rosa is expected to leave more than 25 cm of rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Finally, as the tropical rain meets the approaching low-pressure system, widespread heavy rain will spread across the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, between 2 and 10 centimetres of rain will cause sudden flash floods, debris flows and possible rockfalls in the desert.
Heavy tropical rains will cause flash flooding of 5 to 8 inches per hour in specific areas, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
5 to 10 cm of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially in Arizona.
Due to the dispersed nature of tropical rain, flash floods may occur suddenly with conditions that rapidly deteriorate.
Due to the threat of tropical torrential rains, it is strongly advised not to venture into the desert on foot.
Heavy rains could turn the canyons into raging rivers, and storms could cause localized winds and dust clouds.
The approaching low pressure system will bring heavy rain to specific areas of the southern California coast.
Heavy rains may leave as much as two inches of water, which could cause small flows of debris and make roads slippery.
It would be the first heavy rains of the wet season.
Some scattered tropical showers will approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before widespread rain moves in late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains will continue through the Four Corners area on Tuesday and all day Wednesday.
In October, some intense temperature changes may be observed in the United States as the Arctic cools and the tropics warm.
Sometimes, this can mean drastic changes in temperature over short distances.
A good example of these temperature differences is what will happen across the United States on Sunday.
There will be a difference of almost 7 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha (Nebraska) and between St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa).
Over the next few days, the long-lasting heat of summer will attempt to recover and expand again.
In much of the central and eastern United States, a warm start to October is expected, with temperatures generally in the mid-20s from the Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast.
On Tuesday, New York could see temperatures of up to 26 degrees, some 12 degrees above the average.
Our long-term outlook indicates above-average temperatures for the eastern United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people saw Brett Kavanaugh &apos; s appearance
More than 20 million people followed the harrowing testimony of Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexually assaulting her in the 1980s, on six television networks on Thursday.
Meanwhile, the policy remained in limbo and the media interrupted their regular programming to broadcast the latest developments from Friday: a deal crafted by Arizona Senator Jeff Blake to have the FBI conduct a week-long investigation of the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was absolutely certain that Kavanaugh had groped her while she was drunk at a high school party, and had tried to take off her clothes.
During his passionate testimony, Kavanaugh said he was 100 per cent sure that that had not happened.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people Nielsen mentioned on Friday have seen it.
The company tabulated the average audience for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available to other channels that carried the speech, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also has some problems figuring out how many people see something in the office.
To put it in perspective, it is like a playoff or Oscar night.
Fox News Channel, whose commentators have strongly supported Kavanaugh &apos; s nomination, led the pack, with an average audience of 5.69 million viewers for a full day of testimony, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
The CBS had $3.1 billion, NBC had $2.94 billion, MSNBC had $2.89 billion and CNN had $2.52 billion, Nielsen said.
After the hearing, there was a great deal of interest.
Flake was the central character in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement saying it would vote for Kavanaugh, the morning of Friday, CNN and CBS cameras captured protesters yelling at him as he tried to get into an elevator to attend a hearing before the Judiciary Committee.
As he was being berated, live on CNN, he looked crestfallen.
A woman looked me in the face and said, &quot; Looking at me straight in the face, &quot; &quot; I said, &quot; I don &apos; t know what to do. &quot;
Do you think he is telling the truth to the country?
She continued: "You have power when there are so many women who do not have it."
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and, before the doors of the elevator closed, he would have more to say to the Commission.
Cable and broadcast networks were airing everything live hours later, when the Senate Judiciary Committee had to vote to put Kavanaugh's nomination up for a vote.
However, Flake said he would only do so if the FBI investigated the allegations made against the candidate during the next week, which some Democrats had been calling for.
Flake was convinced, in part, by the conversations he had had with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake &apos; s decision was critical, as it was clear that the Republicans would not have the votes to confirm Kavanaugh without this investigation.
President Trump has ordered the FBI to conduct an investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses Brexit critics of "politicising" the Brexit process
Theresa May, the Prime Minister, accused her critics of "playing politics" with the future of Britain and undermining the national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference to be held in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview published alongside his on the front page of the newspaper, his former Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson, insisted on his attack on the supposed Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that a proposal for Britain and the EU to collect tariffs from each other was "completely ridiculous".
Wayde murder: Simpson arrested as suspect in LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect in the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player, during a shooting.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and jailed on a second-degree murder charge, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police say that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses at the crime scene and said they had found Simpson &apos; s DNA on them, according to WAFB, a CBS affiliate.
After questioning Simpson, police say he admitted shooting Wayde.
A $350,000 bond has been set, according to the defence.
The East Baton Rouge Parish District Court issued a preliminary report on Friday that indicated the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the back of the head that had reached the head.
The department recognizes the merits of the fugitive unit of the Louisiana State Police, the State Police Crime Lab, the Southern University Police Department and the citizens who assisted in the investigation that led to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, LSU &apos; s director of athletics, thanked the local police force for their "diligence and pursuit of justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The player, who was over 2 metres tall, grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at LSU.
He had averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds in the last season.
LSU basketball coach Will Wade said his team was "devastated" and "in shock" by the death of Wayde.
That is what people worry about, said Wade.
Mexico City hit by ash from volcano
Ash from Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern suburbs of Mexico City.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after it showed activity and registered 183 gas and ash emissions in 24 hours.
The centre recorded several tremors and shakes.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash covering the windshields of vehicles in Mexico City neighbourhoods such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed increased activity at the volcano, 72 km south-east of the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck the centre of Mexico in September 2017.
The Don Goyo volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Police face Catalan separatists before independence referendum anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after clashes between Catalan independence protesters and police during a counter-demonstration on the first anniversary of the polarizing Catalan independence referendum.
A group of masked separatists who had been blocked by the riot police threw eggs and powder paint at them, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets, which are normally full of tourists.
There were also confrontations later in the evening and the police used batons to quell the fight.
For several hours, the independence groups, with slogans such as "No amnesia, no forgiveness", clashed with unionists shouting "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests, according to local media.
Tensions remain high in this region one year after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid considers illegal but which separatists in Catalonia celebrate.
The voters chose independence by a majority vote, although turnout was low, as those opposed to secession boycotted the referendum in large numbers.
According to Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting at polling stations across the region, where violent clashes took place.
Pro-independence groups camped out on Friday night to avoid a pro-police rally.
The demonstration continued, but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who was attending the separatist protest with his wife, said he had lost hope that Catalonia would ever become independent.
Last year was one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy at being able to vote, but now we are stuck,” he said.
Despite a narrow victory in December 2011 regional elections, the pro-Kurdish parties have struggled to maintain momentum this year, as many of their most prominent leaders, either in self-imposed exile or in detention, are awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who had recorded the police support protest on his phone, said the conflict had been fanned by politicians on both sides.
He said, "It's getting tighter and tighter."
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in preventive detention since the end of last year, announced that he would be standing in the European Parliament elections next year.
To stand for the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression in democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish Government.
Londonderry: men arrested for crashing car into house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after repeatedly ramming a house in Londonderry with a car.
The incident occurred on Thursday, 19:30, at Ballynagard Crescent.
Inspector Bob Blemmings commented that there had been damage to the access and the building itself.
At some point, it is possible that the car was shot with a crossbow.
A Menga attack gives Livingston a 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston ensured victory
A Livingston team that had been promoted to the SPL impressed Rangers by securing Steven Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's attack made the difference. Gary Holt's men went up a place, with Hibs in second.
This season, Gerrard &apos; s team have yet to win away from home and next Sunday they face Hearts, who lead the table by eight points.
Previously, Rapid Vienna was the visitors on a Thursday in the Europa League.
Meanwhile, Livingston extended its winning streak to six games in the division.
Livingston lets a visitor with a heavy hand pass
The Holt team should have been a step ahead much earlier, causing all kinds of problems for the Rangers with their direct play.
Scott Robinson beat the defence but failed to score from in front of the goal. Alan Lithgow then hit the post after going in for a shot and Craig Halkett scored from in front of the goal.
The host team was content to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause problems for the visitors with their ball-control play.
That was how the decisive blow was struck.
The Rangers gave them a free shot and Livingston looked for an opening, with a combined play from Declan Gallagher and Robinson for Menga, who struck the ball and scored from the centre of the area.
At that point, Rangers were in control of possession, but were unable to break down the host's defence and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was looking pretty calm.
That game continued into the second half, but Alfredo Morelos forced a Kelly stoppage.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor turned away a Scott Pittman shot with his foot, and Livingston were unable to get close to another play from Lithgow.
There were always long passes in the Livingston area, but they were always cleared. Two penalty claims were rejected, one after Glenn Middleton had been substituted and another by a hand.
Livingston (analysis)
Alasdair Lamont, BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Stadium
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
The consensus is that they made a great game that kept exceeding expectations on a rising trajectory.
His style of play and his roster have changed little since his arrival, but that is largely due to Holt's ability to strengthen the team since his arrival.
He had many heroes.
Halkett, the captain, was huge and marshalled a superbly organised defence, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes at all times.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although they had some good times with Gerrard, they came up short.
They failed to materialize their plays, as they only managed to penetrate the opposition's field once, which is a warning to the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan has received an ambiguous welcome in Cologne
Smiles and a blue sky greeted the leaders of Turkey and Germany at breakfast in Berlin on Saturday.
It is the last day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan to Germany, with the aim of restoring relations between NATO allies.
They have discussed issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey &apos; s EU membership.
Then, Erdogan went to Cologne to inaugurate a new huge mosque.
Istanbul is home to the largest population of Turks outside Turkey.
The police cited security concerns to prevent 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many sympathizers gathered in the vicinity to see their president.
Hundreds of opponents of Erdogan, many of them Kurds, also spoke out against both his policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
These demonstrations reflect the divisive nature of this visitor, welcomed as a hero by some German Turks and regarded as an autocrat by others.
Accident in Deptford: cyclist dies after colliding with a vehicle
A cyclist has died in a car crash in London.
The accident occurred near the Bestwookd Street and Evelyn Street junction, a busy road to the east of the city, at 10:15.
The driver of the car stopped and the cyclist was treated by the paramedics, but died on the spot.
The accident occurred after a cyclist died after being hit by a vehicle that fled the scene on Childers Street, almost two kilometres from the scene of Saturday's accident.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the man and inform his family.
Roads have been cut and buses diverted, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: Six officers injured during disturbances
Six prison officers have been injured in a fight in a high-security prison for men, according to the Directorate of the prison.
The disturbances started at HMP Long Lartin, in Worcestershire, at around 9.30am on Sunday and are still ongoing.
A team of elite specialists (known as "Tornado") is dealing with the disturbances, involving eight inmates and a housing unit.
The officers received first aid for facial injuries at the scene.
A prison service spokesman said: "Specialist staff from prisons have been deployed to deal with the incident at HMP Long Lartin."
Six members of staff have received medical assistance for injuries.
In our prisons, violence is not tolerated and we make it clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and may spend more time in jail.”
Long Lartin prison, which holds more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had received hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
In October last year, prison officers were requested to attend the prison to deal with a serious disturbance involving attacks on prison staff with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (arid regions could benefit)
It is unusual for a tropical depression to reach Arizona, but that is exactly what could happen next week when the last remnants of Hurricane Rosa sweep through the southwest desert, with the risk of sudden flash floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood warnings for the western Arizona, southern Nevada, eastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City, for Monday and Tuesday.
It is expected that Rosa will head directly to Phoenix on Tuesday, leaving behind a trail of rain on Monday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted that only 10 hurricanes had maintained their tropical storm or depression status over a 321-kilometer radius from Phoenix since 1950.
In 1967, Hurricane Katrina came within 65 kilometres of the Arizona border.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict between 5 and 10 inches of torrential rainfall, which can reach 15 inches in isolated areas of the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
It is likely to fall between 2 and 5 inches, with the possibility of reaching 10 inches in isolated areas, including the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin.
In places that are not at risk of sudden floods, Rosa rains are considered a blessing, as the region is suffering from drought.
Although a flood is a very serious matter, some of these torrential rains may be beneficial due to the current drought conditions in the southwest.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40 per cent of Arizona is suffering from extreme or worse drought, as reported on weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa will batter the Baja California peninsula.
Hurricane Rosa, which is expected to remain a powerful hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 136 mph (215 km/h) as of Sunday morning, is located 619 miles (997 km) south-southwest of Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and is moving northward at 19 mph (31 km/h).
The storm is running into cooler waters in the Pacific, so it is losing strength.
Thus, it is expected that the storm will reach hurricane strength in Mexico during the afternoon of Monday.
Heavy rains could fall in some parts of Mexico, which are at risk of flooding.
Heavy rains of 7 to 15 inches (17.7 to 38.1 cm) are expected from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with the possibility of reaching 25 inches (63.5 cm), as reported on weather.com.
After that, Rosa will move northward as a tropical storm, before reaching the Arizona-Utah border in the early morning hours of Tuesday as a tropical depression.
The main danger of Rosa or its remains is the torrential downpours in Baja California, northwest Sonora and southwest United States.
These rains are expected to cause sudden flash floods and debris flows in the deserts, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after another 16-year-old boy was found with knife wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton at about 4:00 a.m. on Saturday.
He was transferred to a hospital, where he remains "stable".
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested in the Radstock area of Somerset that same night, according to Avon and Somerset Police.
The agents have made an appeal to anyone who may have witnessed the incident on their mobile phone.
Trump says Kavanaugh "suffered the meanness and the anger of the Democratic Party"
Voting for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and disgusting tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had "suffered the meanness and the anger of the Democrats throughout the entire nomination process."
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, denying the accusation of Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing on this charge.
On Saturday, the president said that, on that day, "Americans saw the shrewdness, the quality and the courage" of Kavanaugh.
Voting to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an impeccable record of service to the public.
The President made indirect references to the Kavanaugh nomination in speaking of the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
There are five weeks to go before one of the most important elections in our lives.
I did not run, but I did run a race,” he said.
That is why I go from one place to another fighting for big names.
Trump claimed that the Democrats were on a mission of "resistance and obstruction."
A senior Republican official told CNN that the first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday.
Hundreds dead in a quake and tsunami in Indonesia, the number is rising
At least 384 people have died and many have been swept away by the huge waves that ravaged the beaches after a strong earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, as reported by authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday night when waves as high as six metres hit the coast in the evening, sweeping many to their deaths and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami occurred after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
When yesterday's tsunami warning was issued, people were still on the beach and did not immediately flee, so they were victims, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the National Agency for Disaster Management (BNPB, in Indonesian) in a press conference in Jakarta.
The tsunami did not come alone, it dragged cars, trees, houses, everything on land, and it moved at 800 km/h across the open sea before hitting the coast.
He also added that some people had climbed trees to escape the tsunami and had survived.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
The aerial photographs published by the agency showed the destruction of many buildings and shops, collapsed bridges and collapsed mosques surrounded by water.
The shelling of the coastal city continued on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area with 2.4 million people.
The Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT, in Indonesian) reported in a statement that the energy released by Friday's earthquake was 200 times greater than that of the atomic bomb that fell on Hiroshima during World War II.
He added that the geography of the city, which is built at the end of a long, narrow bay, may have magnified the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "significant" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He said that bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of destroyed buildings, and that 540 people had been injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the number of victims and damage could be higher along the 300-km stretch of coastline north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicentre of the earthquake.
Communications were "completely paralysed and there was no information" from Donggala, said Nugroho.
More than 300,000 people live there, the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
That is a tragedy in itself, but it could get a lot worse.
On Saturday, the agency was criticised for not reporting that a tsunami had hit Palu, although the authorities say the waves had already reached the coast when the alert was issued.
In a video shot by an amateur and shared on social media, a man on the top floor of a building is heard warning people in the street that a tsunami was approaching.
In a matter of minutes, a wall of water hits the coast, sweeping away buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to verify the material immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major blackout that cut communications in the vicinity of Palu, hampering the coordination of rescue efforts.
The military began sending cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, according to authorities, but evacuees still need food and other basic supplies.
The city airport has reopened for relief operations only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has a scheduled visit to the evacuation centres on Sunday.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia is higher than 800.
It is very bad.
Although World Vision staff in Donggala had arrived safely in Palu, where they were sheltering under tarpaulins in the garden of their offices, they had seen a devastating scene on their way, said Mr. Doseba.
He said he had seen many houses destroyed.
It is very bad.
Even as the disaster-relief gears were being put into motion, some people were complaining that the movement of experienced relief workers to Palu was being prevented.
According to Indonesian regulations, only foreign funding, supplies and staffing can be sought for a disaster area if it is declared a national disaster area.
And that hasn &apos; t happened yet.
"It is still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
As soon as the Government says it is a national disaster, we can start to provide international assistance, but that has not happened yet.
As the second night fell on Palu after the earthquake and tsunami of Friday, friends and family of the missing still hoped for a miracle that would bring some light to the stories of the natural disasters.
A small child was rescued from a manhole on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days next to the body of her mother.
Gendon Subandono, national team coach for Indonesia's paragliding team, had trained two of the missing athletes for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Some of the people trapped in the Hotel Roa Roa, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
As someone who has been involved in the field of paragliding, I carry my own emotional baggage.
Mr Gendon recalled how, in the hours following the news that the Roa Roa hotel had collapsed in the paragliding community, he had sent desperate WhatsApp messages to competitors in Palu, who were taking part in the festival on the beach.
However, their messages only showed a grey verification mark, not two blue ones.
I think that means the messages were not delivered," he said.
Thieves made off with $26,750 during a cash withdrawal at a Newport on the Levee ATM
On Friday morning, two armed robbers robbed a Brink employee who was refilling an ATM at Newport on the Levee, taking $26,750, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the vehicle had emptied an automated teller machine located in the center of entertainment and was preparing to reload it with more money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in the note.
While he was busy, another man "ran up behind the Brink employee and stole a bag of money intended for recharging."
According to the note, witnesses saw several suspects leaving the scene, but the police did not specify the number of suspects involved in the incident.
Any person with information about the identity of these individuals should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West will now be known as Ye.
The change was announced on Twitter on Saturday: "The person formerly known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been called Ye for some time now, and that is the name of his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes before it appears on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to debut his new album, Yandhi.
The show was originally scheduled to feature Ariana Grande, who had to cancel her performance due to "emotional reasons," according to the creator of the program.
In addition to being a short form of his professional name, West had previously said that the word had a religious significance for him.
I think it is the most used word in the Bible, which means "you", West said in January while talking about the title of the album with radio host Big Boy.
It means "I am you, you are me, we are one."
He went from being Kanye, which means "the only one", to Ye, a reflection of our good, bad and confusing things, all.
The album is more a reflection of who we are.
He is one of the many famous rappers who has changed his name.
Sean Combs has been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
A former collaborator of West, Jay-Z, has used his name in capital letters or lower case, with or without a script.
Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has promised not to use the army against the civilian population.
Andrés Manuel López Obrador, the newly elected Mexican president, has promised never to use the army against the civilian population again, as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students.
On Saturday, López Obrador promised in Plaza Tlatelolco that "he would never use the army to repress the people of Mexico."
On 2 October 1968, the military fired on a peaceful demonstration in Tlatelolco, killing 300 people at a time when the student movements of the left were gaining strength throughout Latin America.
President López Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by providing them with monthly stipends for those who study and opening more public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities led young people to join criminal gangs.
The United States should double its funding for I.A.
Now that China is more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double its investment in research in this area, says Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and I.A. professional who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments came after announcements by several parts of the U.S. Government, even though, in general, the United States lacked an official I.A. strategy.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: its goal is to become the number one innovator in AI by 2030.
“Doubling the budget for I.A. research would be a good start, given that all other countries are lagging behind the United States in this area. We are looking to the next step in the field of I.A.”, comments Lee.
More funding means more opportunities for the next great achievement in the U.S. to come out of the U.S.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the executive director of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's most important I. A. companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he developed a computer program that defeated the best American player of Othello. He later became an executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google China.
He acknowledged the previous technological competitions of the U.S. Government, such as the DARPA Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be, which would identify the next generation of visionaries.
In the United States, researchers have to work hard to get Government funding, said Lee.
It is not China that is taking the leaders of academia; it is the corporations," said Lee.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired prominent university researchers to work on I. A.
Lee commented that changes in U.S. immigration policy could also help intensify U.S. efforts in I.A.
I think that I. A. doctors should be issued permanent residency cards automatically.
The State Council of China released its Plan for the Development of the Next Generation of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
The National Natural Science Foundation of China funds both individuals and institutions, as does the National Science Foundation in the United States, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
In early 2001, the US Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, whose purpose is to attract partners from the industrial and academic sectors. The White House also announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in a program called AI Next.
As for the National Science Foundation, it currently invests more than $100 million per year in I. A. research.
Meanwhile, the United States legislation to create a National Commission on Artificial Intelligence Security has not taken any action for months.
The Macedonians decided in a referendum whether to change their country's name
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether their country should be renamed "Republic of Macedonia of the North", a move that would resolve a decades-old conflict with Greece, which had blocked its bid for EU membership and NATO membership.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that its northern neighbour's name is a territorial claim and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, both governments reached an agreement on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would diminish the ethnic identity of the Macedonian Slav majority.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has cast doubt on whether the minimum 50 per cent turnout required for the referendum to be valid will be reached.
The referendum ballot paper asked: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to try to bring Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the disintegration of Yugoslavia, into bodies like the EU and NATO.
I have come here today to vote for the future of my country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live in freedom under the protection of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us.
Although it will not be legally binding, many members of Parliament have said they will respect the outcome of the vote so that it will be decisive.
A change of name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission declared that, at 1 p.m., no irregularities had been reported.
However, voter turnout was only 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent in the 2016 parliamentary elections, when 66 per cent of registered voters cast their ballots.
Gjose Tanevski, 62, said: "I have come to vote for my children, our place is in Europe."
Zoran Zaev, Prime Minister of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and son Dushko cast their votes in the referendum on changing the name of the country, which would open the way for joining NATO and the European Union in Strumica (Macedonia) on 30 September 2018.
In front of the Parliament in Skopie, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was setting up a small stage and removing chairs from the tents of those who were boycotting the referendum.
We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to do it with our heads held high, not through the back door," said Kavadarkov.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don &apos; t want us to come in as Macedonia, we can establish relations with other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of the Euro-Asian integration.
The Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership would bring the investment that Macedonia so badly needs, whose unemployment rate is over 20 per cent.
I believe that the majority will be in favour, as more than 80 per cent of citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO.
He said that a positive outcome would be a "confirmation of our future."
A survey published on Monday by the Institute for Policy Studies put the turnout at between 30 and 43 per cent, which is lower than the required turnout.
Another poll conducted by Telma TV, in Macedonia, revealed that 57 per cent of those polled planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 per cent said they would vote in favour.
For the referendum to be considered a success, the turnout must be 50 % plus one vote.
If it fails, it would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government since it came to power in May last year.
Look at this: Sergio Agüero, of Manchester City, evades the entire Brighton defence to score a goal
Sergio Agüero and Raheem Sterling tore apart Brighton's defence in Manchester City's 2-0 win at the Etihad Stadium on Saturday.
For Agüero, it was ridiculously easy to score in the 65th minute.
Argentina &apos; s Argentinian midfielder received a yellow card in the middle of the game.
He ran between three Brighton defences before breaking into open country.
Once there, he was surrounded by four green T-shirts.
He evaded a defender before out-jumping several more in the Brighton penalty area.
He made a left turn, where Sterling was.
England forward Jermain Defoe used his first touch in the area to return the ball to Aguero, who struck it with his right foot to avoid goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot that hit the right post.
City manager Pep Guardiola said Aguero had a problem with his foot.
We are talking about a 55-60 minute game.
That is what happened.
We were lucky to get that goal at that time.
However, it was Sterling who gave City the initial advantage in the Premier League title race.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
In that play, Agüero received the ball very deep in the Brighton territory.
He made a lovely ball to the left side for Leroy Sane.
Sane gave Sterling a few taps before directing him to the second pole.
The Sky Blues forward fired the ball into the net just before going offside.
The City will face Hoffenheim in a Champions League group stage match on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. local time at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to spoil the Rockies' party
With the Nationals out of the playoff picture, there was no reason to force another opening.
Even so, the always competitive Scherzer is hoping to climb the mound on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Dodgers, who play in the National League West, still have playoff hopes.
The Rockies have at least one wild-card berth locked up thanks to a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they are still chasing their first division title.
Although we are not playing for anything, at least we can step on the rubber with the certainty that the Denver crowd will be energized and that the other team will likely be playing at the highest level I have faced this year.
Why wouldn &apos; t you want to participate?
The Nationals still have to announce a starter for Sunday, but it looks like they are leaning toward letting Scherzer go in that situation.
Scherzer, who will make his 34th opening, practiced on Thursday and will return to his normal rest on Sunday.
Washington's southpaw has a 18-7 record with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 games.
Trump holds a rally in West Virginia
The President made indirect references to the Kavanaugh situation, his selection to the Supreme Court, when speaking of the importance of Republican participation in midterm elections.
In November, everything we have done is at stake.
Five weeks to one of the most important elections of our lives.
It is one of the most important. I don't run, but I do go from place to place fighting for great candidates, so I am always on the move.
He continued: "We have this terrible radical group of Democrats, they are here now."
And they are determined to regain power by any means necessary, and the meanness, the evil.
They don &apos; t care who they hurt or who they have to step on to get power and control, that &apos; s what they want, power and control, and we &apos; re not going to give it to them.
Democrats, he said, were embarked on a mission of "resistance and obstruction."
He said, "We have seen that over the last four days." He said, "Democrats are furious, they are bad, they are horrible and they are false."
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee, nominating Senator Dianne Feinstein, who was booed by the audience.
Do you remember his answer?
Do you filter the document?
Mmm, Mmm, &quot; What? &quot;
No, no mmm, I hope you will answer. His body language was terrible, the worst I have ever seen.”
The Labour Party already encompasses a wide range of views.
It is intolerant of people who say what they think
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censure me, I was hardly surprised.
After all, I am the last of a line of Labour MPs who are told that we are not welcome, and only for saying what we think.
My colleague Joan Ryan received a similar treatment for being categorically against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticised me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
He disagreed with the importance of a responsible economic policy in terms of national security for Europe. It is ironic that he was in disagreement with leaders on issues on which he was in disagreement with previous leaders.
As the Labour Party East Nottingham Friday meeting notice put it, "we want our meetings to be inclusive and productive."
During the eight years I have been a Member of Parliament for the local Labour Party, that is exactly what the Friday night meetings of the General Committee have been.
Unfortunately, this is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of a "more friendly and compassionate" policy has long since been forgotten, if it ever was implemented in the first place.
It is becoming clearer that Labour is not a tolerant party and that every opinion is judged in terms of whether the party leadership considers it acceptable or not.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues with whom he had previously shared a political vision started to expect him to change his mind radically and adopt positions he had never agreed with, whether on national security or on the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public, regardless of what I say, there is a barrage of insults on social media demanding my removal, denouncing the centre's policies, telling me I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
I am not the only one who has experienced this.
Yes, I am aware that I am luckier than some of my colleagues, as the comments about me tend to be political.
I am amazed at the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face a daily torrent of sexist or racist abuse, but never run away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is the normalization of insults.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer have that broad range of views, and with every motion to censure or change in the selection rules, the party becomes narrower.
Over the past two years, I have received many pieces of advice that recommended that I keep my head down and not make too much noise, and that this would be good for me.
But I have not entered politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolboy, motivated by the neglect of the Thatcher Government which left my comprehensive school literally in ruins, I have tried to support improvements in public services for those who need them most, whether as a councillor or as a Minister in Government.
I have never hidden my political views, and I certainly did not do so in the last election.
It is impossible that anyone in Nottingham East would not know my political positions and areas where I disagreed with the current leadership.
All I would say to those who promoted the motion on Friday is that I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on questions about my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party when the country is hurtling towards a Brexit that will affect homes, businesses and public services.
The real message is not for Momentum Nottingham, but for the voters, whether they are Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of withdrawal or political opportunism will stop me from acting in what I believe is best for all of you.
Chris Leslie is a Member of Parliament for Nottingham East
Ayr 38 - Melrose 17: an unbeaten Ayr tops the table
Two late tries may have decided the final outcome, but without doubt, Ayr deserved the victory in this entertaining Tennent &apos; s Premiership match.
They are now the top of the table and the only undefeated team of the ten.
In the end, it was the superiority of their defence, as well as their ability to make the most of opportunities, that gave the local team the victory, so coach Peter Murchie had every right to be pleased.
We have been tested in all ways and we are still standing, so I have to be happy about that.
Robyn Christie, of Melrose, said: "Ayr deserves the recognition, they took advantage of the opportunities better than us."
Grant Anderson &apos; s 14th-minute try, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead, but a yellow card shown to Scotland captain Rory Hughes, on loan to the Warriors for the match, allowed Melrose to take advantage of the opposition &apos; s disadvantage and Jason Baggot kicked a penalty that was not converted.
Ayr extended its lead with a penalty. Just before the half-time break, he scored and converted a solo effort, leaving the score at 17-5 in favour of Ayr at the break.
However, the Melrose started well in the second half and Patrick Anderson &apos; s conversion by Baggot reduced the lead to five points.
There was a long delay after Ruaridh Knott sustained a serious injury and had to be stretchered off, and when the game resumed, Ayr went ahead with a Stafford McDowall try converted by Climo.
The yellow card to Blair Macpherson, captain of Ayr, allowed Melrose to take advantage of having one more man on the field with Bruce Colvine's non-converted try at the end of a period of intense pressure.
However, the locals recovered and when Struan Hutchinson was yellow-carded for pleasing Climo without the ball, from the penalty spot, MacPherson made a try from the back of the maul that was advancing.
The weather turned him, as it had been doing almost since the game resumed, after Kyle Rowe received the ball from David Armstrong and sent Gregor Henry to the bottom of the wing for the fifth shot at goal.
The Still Game star wants to steer his career towards the restoration sector
Ford Kieran, the star of Still Game, seems determined to move into the restoration business after being named the head of a chain of restaurants.
The actor, 56, is Jack Jarvis, who is best known for his role in the BBC sitcom, which he writes and co-stars with his long-time comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The duo has announced that the ninth season will be the last, and it seems that Kiernan is making plans for life after Craiglang.
According to the official record, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the matter, but a source from the Scottish Sun claimed that Kiernan wanted to get involved in the "booming Glasgow restoration market".
Bolivia without a coastline: hopes that the court will reopen the Pacific route
Navy personnel are based at a naval headquarters in La Paz.
Blue flags fly from public buildings.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, naval bases display the motto: "The sea is ours by right."
It is a duty to recover it.”
In all of Bolivia, a land without sea, the lost coast of Chile, which was fought over in a bloody conflict for resources in the 19th century, is still remembered vividly, as is the desire to sail the Pacific Ocean again.
These hopes may be the greatest in decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling from the International Court of Justice on 1 October, after five years of deliberations.
Bolivia has the impetus, a spirit of unity and calm, and, of course, is waiting for the results with a positive vision, said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the International Court of Justice ruling on large screens set up throughout the country, hoping that the International Court of Justice in The Hague will rule in Bolivia &apos; s favour, that Chile has an obligation to negotiate to grant Bolivia sovereign access to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who is locked in a controversial battle over re-election next year, also has much to say about Monday's resolution.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he said at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to rule in Bolivia &apos; s favour and that the situation would not change much if it did.
The United Nations agency based in the Netherlands has no power to award Chilean territory and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of any possible negotiations.
The fact that the International Court of Justice took six months to reach a decision after the final submissions indicated that the case was "not complicated", said Chilean expert Paz Zárate.
Far from promoting Bolivia's cause, the last four years may have actually impeded it.
The problem of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration, said Zárate.
He also suggested that Morales &apos; s bellicose rhetoric has undermined any residual goodwill among Chileans.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk, but it will be extremely difficult to have conversations after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, the Bolivian representative to the ICJ, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making was unusually swift.
On Monday, Bolivia would be offered "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile and to end 139 years of mutual benefit disagreements", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who remains one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, was using the maritime issue as a political football.
Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean, he added.
The resolution is an opportunity to see what we need to leave behind.
North Korea says it will not give up nuclear weapons unless it can trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never lead the way in nuclear disarmament if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke to the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to keep its promises made at a summit in Singapore between the rival leaders.
His comments come as Mike Pompeo, the US Secretary of State, appears to be about to resume nuclear diplomacy talks that have been stalled for more than three months since this summit with Kim Jong-un, the leader of North Korea.
He says that the continuation of the ongoing sanctions and the United States &apos; opposition to a statement that would end the Korean War and submit North Korea are a "pipe dream".
Washington is wary of accepting the declaration without Pyongyang making a significant disarmament move first.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want another summit.
However, there is a widespread scepticism about North Korea's seriousness in giving up its arsenal, which the country probably sees as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo is expected to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for another summit between the leaders.
The Paris fashion shows reveal the last line of enormous hats about to land on a street near you
If you want to increase your collection of hats or protect yourself from the sun, you need look no further.
Valentino and Thom Browne designers presented a collection of eccentric, oversized hats for their spring/summer 2019 collection on the runway, dazzling the Paris Fashion Week style.
Instagram has been flooded with impossible hats this summer, and these designers have taken their spectacular creations to the runway.
Valentino &apos; s most outstanding piece was a beige hat with a wide brim adorned with feathers that covered the heads of the models.
Other large items included pineapples with jewels, a wizard hat and even a pineapple, but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also showed a selection of outlandish masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colourful masks had sewn-up lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter more than haute couture.
One sculpture recalled a full scuba team, including the diver and mask, while another looked like a melted ice-cream cone.
If you like big fashion, you're in luck.
The haters predict that the big hats could start to appear on the streets of shops.
The big hats are coming strong from "La Bomba", with a straw hat with a 60-centimetre wing used by all, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label that accompanied this impractical hat that flooded social media presented another great creation on the runway: a beach bag as big as the model in the bikini that carried it.
The Jacquemus orange-brown raffia bag, decorated with raffia fringe and with a white leather handle, was the main piece of the Jacquemus La Riviera collection for the spring-summer 2019 Paris Fashion Week.
As stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "Next summer, I hope to see huge beach bags and hats on the high street. Since the designer has had such an impact, it would be hard to ignore the demand for big accessories."
John Edward: linguistic skills are fundamental for citizens of the world
The independent schools in Scotland have a long history of academic excellence, which has continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding results in the exams, which is further enhanced by individual and collective success in the areas of sport, art, music and other community projects.
With more than 30,000 pupils in all of Scotland, these centres, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS, for its English initials), are striving to deliver the best possible service to pupils and parents.
Independent schools are designed to prepare their students for further education, for the career they choose and for the role they will play as citizens of the world.
As a sector of education that can design and implement an adapted curriculum, modern languages are still popular and in demand in the centres.
As Nelson Mandela said, &quot; If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head. If you talk to him in his language, that goes to his heart. &quot;
If you speak to them in their language, it reaches their heart.
This is a powerful reminder that, if you want to establish relationships and build trust with people from other countries, you can't rely solely on English.
If we look at the results of this year &apos; s language tests, we can see that the languages are at the top of the tables, with the highest pass rates in independent schools.
Overall, 68 per cent of students who studied foreign languages received an A, the highest grade.
Data from the 74 centres that make up the SCIS showed that 72 per cent of students achieved an A in Chinese, 72 per cent in German, 69 per cent in French and 63 per cent in Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages because they see them as a fundamental skill that children and young people will need for sure in the future.
Languages are currently considered to be on the same level as the STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) subjects in the independent school curriculum plans and everywhere else.
A survey conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 found that 17 per cent of employers cited language skills as a barrier to filling vacancies.
Therefore, linguistic skills are becoming increasingly essential for preparing young people for their future careers.
The potential for language skills in the workplace is increasing, so these skills are essential in a globalized world.
No matter what career someone chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future thanks to this kind of competition, which will last a lifetime.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically put that person ahead of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 per cent of them did not speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation.
That is why it is important to invest in language education for today &apos; s children.
If you know more than one language, especially those of developing economies, children will be better equipped to find a quality job.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Some centres will focus on the more traditional modern languages, while others will teach the most important languages for the UK in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interests of a child, in independent schools he or she will always be able to choose between several languages taught by specialist staff.
Scotland's independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that prepares children for life and equips them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future may hold.
It is undeniable that, in a global business environment, languages continue to be of vital importance to the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages must be seen as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer these options, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
You have to do it.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Independent Schools Council
LeBron James makes his Lakers debut Sunday in San Diego
The wait for LeBron James to make his debut with the Los Angeles Lakers is almost over.
Luke Walton, the Lakers &apos; coach, announced that James would play in the Lakers &apos; season opener on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, the length of the game is still to be determined.
It will be more than one and less than 48, Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers beat reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would likely play a limited number of minutes.
After a training session earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers &apos; six-game preseason schedule.
At this stage of my career, I don &apos; t need pre-season camps to prepare myself.
Trump rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will hold a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five Trump campaign events scheduled for next week, including stops in Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote of his nominee to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court, Trump is seeking support for the next midterm elections, as Republicans run the risk of losing control of Congress if the votes are cast in November.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight and how can it be seen online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7:00 p.m. Eastern Time on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can see it online via a live YouTube feed.
It is likely that Trump will comment on this week &apos; s Kavanaugh hearings, which were marred by sexual misconduct allegations and have left the Senate in limbo for at least a week while the FBI investigates.
However, the main objective of this series of meetings is to help Republicans facing the November elections to gain momentum.
Thus, the Trump campaign said that the five rallies next week are intended to "energize volunteers and supporters while Republicans try to protect and expand their majorities in the Senate and House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
The control of Congress is so crucial to his agenda that Trump will travel to as many states as possible while campaigning, a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters, but declined to give his name.
The rally tonight at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract sympathizers from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media coverage from Pittsburgh, as reported by the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in a month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, the Republican candidate for the Senate in West Virginia, who is falling behind in the polls.
For Morrisey, it was not a good sign that the president had to come to his rescue in the polls, according to Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, as reported by Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: the United States team shows that it is willing to fight to keep the hope of Sunday's singles alive.
After three individual sessions, the foursomes on Saturday afternoon may be what this Ryder Cup needed.
The pendulum swing is a completely invented concept in sport, but the players really believe in it, even more so in competitions like this.
So where is the impetus now?
We were six points ahead and now they are four points ahead, so I guess that is a little bit of a push, &quot; said Jordan Spieth after the round.
Europe has an advantage, of course: four points ahead with 12 more at stake.
As Spieth points out, Americans feel they have something of a tailwind and plenty of reasons to be upbeat, among them the pairing of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and earned four points from four.
Spieth has been lethal off the tee and preaches with his example.
The guttural roars of celebration grew louder as the round progressed, introducing a vital putt to tie the fourth round when Thomas and he were two down after two holes.
The putt that the Americans gave them on the 15th was greeted with a similar roar, one that suggested that the Americans had not yet been eliminated.
What we need to do is redouble our efforts and focus on the game," said Spieth.
That is what these players have done.
18 craters to leave your mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas over the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undeniable history of the Ryder Cup.
The odd and adorable couple of Europe have won four out of four and nothing can go wrong.
The only pair to avoid a bogey on Saturday was "Moliwood", but they also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday evening and the last nine holes of Friday morning.
That run and the way their energy flows with the noisy crowd on Sunday leave no doubt that these are the players to beat on Sunday, and that there will be no other players as popular as Fleetwood and Molinari to seal a possible European victory when the sun sets at Le Golf National.
Preferably, two holes in different holes.
However, it is still premature to talk about European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson dispatched Sergio Garcia, the hero of the four-ball morning, after teaming up with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first nine holes buried the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole from which they could not escape.
But there will be no help on Sunday to get out of the holes.
Foursomes and fourballs are fascinating to watch because you can see the interactions between the couples, the advice they give and the advice they don't, and the way a strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team and has a big lead going into the last day, but this foursomes session also showed that the US team was willing to fight, something that some, especially the Americans, doubted.
Europe leads by 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe leads by a good margin on the final day of the Ryder Cup, after the fourballs and foursomes had ended with a 10-6 win over the United States.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the contest with two wins over a Tiger Woods who was in trouble, moving four points clear in the FedExCup standings.
European Thomas Bjorn, trying to hang on to the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated a US team that made many errors in the morning foursomes, which ended 3-1.
The United States fought back in the foursomes, winning two matches, but failed to close the gap.
American Jim Furyk needs to get eight points from the 12-man individual matches on Sunday to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four consecutive points. He and Molinari, who were dubbed "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are the second pair to win four points in their first four matches in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the foursomes, their magnificent partnership helped to beat a dejected Woods and a rookie American Bryson DeChambeau by a convincing 5-4.
Woods, who had not really stood out in either of the two Saturday matches, had occasional flashes of brilliance, but now he has lost 19 of his 29 fourballs and foursomes, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who was rested for the morning foursomes, returned with Henrik Stenson for the afternoon fourballs, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the world's number one and three players respectively, 2-1.
Although the weather was pleasant and calm in southwest Paris, Europe was not having all its own way.
Jordan Spieth, a three-time winner, and Justin Thomas were the reference point for the Americans, who earned two points on Saturday.
They secured a thrilling 2&apos; 1 victory over Ian Poulter and Jon Rahm in the fourballs and then beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&apos; 3 in the foursomes after losing the first two holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, a team has recovered from a four-point deficit in the singles only twice, but Furyk, as the trophy holder, only needs a tie to keep it.
Although they have been the second best for two days, it seems that mounting a counter-attack on Sunday is beyond their capabilities.
North Korea says there is "no possibility" of unilateral disarmament unless it has confidence.
On Saturday, the Foreign Minister of North Korea informed the United Nations that the continuation of sanctions deepened his country &apos; s distrust of the United States and that there was no possibility of his country unilaterally giving up its nuclear weapons under these circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho, the Director-General of the United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency, told the General Assembly that North Korea had taken "important steps of goodwill" in the past year, including halting nuclear tests and missile launches, dismantling nuclear test facilities and committing to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
However, we have not received a similar response from the United States.
If we do not have confidence in the United States, we cannot have confidence in our national security, and, in those circumstances, there is no possibility of unilateral disarmament.
Although Ri repeated the familiar complaints of North Korea about Washington's resistance to a "phased" denuclearization formula that rewards Pyongyang for taking steps, his statement was important, as he did not reject a unilateral denuclearization out of hand, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump after the first summit between an American president and a North Korean leader on 12 June in Singapore, when Kim Jong Un committed to working towards "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula" and Trump guaranteed the security of North Korea.
North Korea has pursued the official end of the Korean War (1950-53), but the United States has said that Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons before it can give up its arms.
Washington has also resisted calls to ease international sanctions on North Korea.
The United States has insisted on nuclear disarmament first and has increased pressure through sanctions in order to achieve its goal coercively, even objecting to a declaration of the end of war.
The idea that sanctions can make us fall on our knees is a fantasy of people who do not know us.
The problem is that the continuation of sanctions deepens our mistrust.”
He did not mention any plans for a second Trump-Kim summit, announced with great fanfare by the US president at the United Nations at the start of the week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in in the past five months, and added: "If South Korea had been the party interested in denuclearization instead of the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not be in such a stalemate."
Even so, Ri's tone was radically different from last year, when he told the United Nations General Assembly that it was inevitable that missiles fired by North Korea would land on American soil after "malign" President Trump called Kim Jong-un "rocket man".
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in moving towards disarmament, but said there was still much to do and that sanctions should be maintained until North Korea denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no deadline for this: "We can take two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its advances.
However, as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the Security Council on Thursday, "The imposition of sanctions by the Security Council must continue vigorously and without deviation until we realize a fully verifiable and complete denuclearization."
The Security Council has imposed sanctions on North Korea unanimously since 2006 in an attempt to cut off funding for its ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programmes.
Pompeo chatted with Ri outside the United Nations General Assembly and later said he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, but within hours North Korea had denounced its "demands as those of a gangster".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States took "appropriate measures."
He said Kim had told him that the "measures" he was seeking were the security guarantees Trump had promised in Singapore and steps towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to get enough sleep
Thanks to a new course being taught this year at Harvard University, all students are now sleeping more in an attempt to combat the growing culture of all-night studying fuelled by caffeine.
A professor discovered that students at the top university in the world often have no idea about basic self-care.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, and a specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital designed the course, believed to be the first of its kind in the United States.
His motivation to start the course came after giving a talk on how sleep deprivation affects learning.
At the end of the course, a girl came up to me and asked why she was just finding out about this now, in her last year.
He said that no one had ever spoken to him about the importance of dreams, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, offered for the first time this year, explains to students the basics of how good sleep habits contribute to academic and athletic performance, as well as overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a psychiatry professor at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university &apos; s health services, noted that the university had decided to introduce the course after discovering that students were sleeping only during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is an image of a bedroom, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sports shoes and books that inform them of the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of lack of sleep on athletic performance and the importance of establishing a bedtime routine.
In another section, participants are informed of how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
After that, a campus icon with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
We know that students are not going to change their behaviour immediately.
However, we believe that they have a right to know, just as any person has a right to know the health effects of smoking tobacco.”
He said that the culture of "staying up all night" still existed and added that modern technology and increased pressure on students meant that sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
Sleeping enough and a good night's sleep should be "the secret weapon" of students to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety; even to avoid gaining weight, since sleep deprivation makes the brain feel hungry, so students want to eat all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying biochemistry and physics, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes the previous year during his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to expand it to the entire campus.
The next step is to ask all graduate students to complete a similar program of study before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler &apos; s recommendation is that students set an alarm to go to bed and another to wake up, and be aware of the negative effects of &quot; blue light &quot; emitted by computer and LED screens, which can alter circadian rhythms, so that they will have trouble falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - Rangers 0: Menga goal sinks Gerrard men
The Rangers suffered another bout of depression away from home, when the Dolly Menga attack saw Steven Gerrard &apos; s disjointed team beaten 1-0 at Livingston.
Rangers wanted their first away win since February 4's 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team beat them for the second time in 18 games as manager, leaving them eight points behind Hearts, who lead the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga's attack came just minutes before half-time and Rangers' uninspiring alignment was never going to be enough.
Now, Rangers drop to sixth, Livingston move up to third, behind Hibs by goal difference.
The Rangers may have more problems, as judge of the line Calum Spence had to receive medical assistance after allegedly being hit on the head by an object from the visiting stand.
Gerrard changed eight of the 11 players who won the game against Ayr, reaching the Scottish League Cup semi-finals.
Holt, meanwhile, had taken 11 Livingston players who had earned a point against Hearts last week and would have been pleased with the way his well-drilled team had dominated their opponents throughout.
The Rangers may have had more possession, but Livingston made better use of the ball when they had it.
They should have been booked at two minutes into the game when Menga made a run into space for Scott Pittman, which passed between the defence, leaving him alone in front of Allan McGregor, but the midfielder sent her off.
Keaghan Jacobs was penalized for a high tackle on captain Craig Halkett, but his partner in defence, Alan Lithgow, could only kick it out from the long-range.
The Rangers regained control, but it seemed that there was more hope than conviction in their play in the third period.
There is no doubt that Alfredo Morelos felt he had been penalized in the 15th minute of the game when he and Steven Lawless collided, but referee Steven Thomson ignored Colombian Morelos &apos; s request.
The Rangers had two goals in the first half, but former Ibrox keeper Liam Kelly barely broke sweat dealing with Lassana Coulibaly's header and Ovie Ejaria's long-range effort.
Although Livingston's 34th-minute goal was against all odds, no one can deny that they deserved it for the effort they put in.
Again, the Rangers were unable to deal with a deep ball from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher played the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his cool and passed the ball to Menga to score.
In the break, Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, which had an almost immediate impact, as Morelos was able to feed the ball to Moreno, but Kelly stepped out of his line to block him.
Even so, Livingston continued to take his visitors exactly where he liked, with Lithgow and Halkett clearing the way with long passes.
Holt's men could have made more of a game of it in the final stages, but McGregor stood firm to deny Jacobs before Lithgow finished off a header that didn't go in.
The Rangers substitute, Glen Middleton, claimed a penalty in the dying minutes of the game after a clash with Jacobs, but Thomson again looked the other way.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, a page from the "Sunday Morning Almanac": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, and COUNTING... was born in Germany the physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radiation, culminating in the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter, which has since become a pillar of science, also became a pillar of pop culture, as in the 1950 film &quot; The Singing Hills &quot;, with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in the seemingly incompatible roles of cowboy scientists:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium."
When you put on the headphones, you can hear the effect of the radioactivity of the minerals.”
Evans: "It's like a radio!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, at the age of 63.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine may teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells
A new cancer vaccine may teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells and kill them.
As part of the treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells.
The method requires the extraction of immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory.
Thus, they can "see" a common protein in many cancers and redirect them.
A promising trial of a vaccine is under way in patients with different cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognise cancer cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method requires the extraction of immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a common protein found in many cancers, called HER2, and then reinjecting the cells.
Jay Berzofsky, a professor at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, commented: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "promotes growth of different types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer," explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach of taking immune cells from patients and "teaching" them to attack cancerous cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West went on a rant in support of Trump wearing a MAGA hat after his appearance on SNL.
It didn't work out.
Kanye West was jeered on Saturday Night Live after a performance that was erratic, in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for office in 2020.
After the third song of the night, called Ghost Town, during which he wore the hat with the message Make America Great Again, he started to rant against Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
I often speak to someone white and they ask me how I can like Trump when he is racist.
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago," he said.
SNL started the show with a sketch of Matt Damon making fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding the sexual assault allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, Chris Rock posted the rant on social media.
It is unclear whether Rock was trying to ridicule West with the publication.
West also told the audience that he had had a hard time backstage wearing that hat.
They messed with me.
They told me not to wear my hat.
They messed with me!
And then they tell me I'm asleep,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see me asleep?" and added that he was "going to put on his cape of invincibility, because that meant that nobody could tell him what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?"
Try with love.
His comments were booed by the audience at least twice, and SNL members appeared to be embarrassed, according to Variety. One person told the magazine: "The study was completely silent."
West had been invited to replace the singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died recently.
West confounded many when he came on stage dressed as a bottle of Perrier singing I Love it.
West received the support of the leader of the conservative TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR FIGHTING AGAINST THE MASSES."
Karen Hunter, a talk show host, tweeted that West was "just being himself and that is absolutely wonderful."
But I choose not to reward someone (buying their music or clothes, or supporting their art) who I believe is embracing and spreading a dangerous ideology to my community.
He is free.
We also”, he added.
Before the program, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now "the person formerly known as Kanye West."
It is not the first artist to change his name, following in the footsteps of Puff Daddy, also known as P Diddy, Puffy and Puff Daddy.
His colleague, Snoop Dogg, has also been known as Snoop Lion, without forgetting the late music legend Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and then to an artist previously known as Prince.
Attempted murder by stabbing in a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, according to the Police.
The accused is expected to appear in Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the prosecution.
Kit Harington, star of Game of Thrones, attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his role as Jon Snow in the violent fantasy series Game of Thrones on HBO.
The actor, 31, has attacked the stereotype of the male hero, saying that those roles on screen often told young men they had to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed "something had gone wrong" and questioned how to tackle toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, 31, admitted that he thought it was "fairly important" to address the issue.
I think it is quite important at this point in time, "Where have we gone wrong with masculinity?"
What have we been teaching men as they grow up, thinking about the problems they see now?
Kit believes that television may have some responsibility for the growing toxic masculinity due to its male characters.
He continued: "What is innate and what is taught?"
What is being taught on television and in the street that makes young men feel they have to be this particular kind of man?
I think that is one of the great questions of our time: how do we change it?
Because it is clear that something has gone wrong in the education of young people.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not be involved in any Game of Thrones spin-offs when the series ends next summer, saying he was "tired of battlefields and horses".
From November, Kit will star in True West, Sam Shepard &apos; s play about a film producer and his brother, a thief.
He recently revealed that he believes knowing his wife Rose is the best thing he has taken away from Game of Thrones.
I met my wife on the show, so in that sense, I have my future family and my life from now on.
Rose played Ygritte, Jon Snow &apos; s love interest in the fantasy series that won Emmy awards.
The couple married in June 2018 at a farm in Leslie, Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14 per cent more new cases
China has announced a 14 per cent increase in the number of people living with HIV/AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have been affected in the country, according to health authorities.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, some 40,000 new cases were reported.
Most of these cases were sexually transmitted, which is a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contracted HIV in this way had dropped to zero in practice, Chinese health officials said at a conference in the province of Yunnan.
Every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increases by about 100,000.
HIV transmission through sexual intercourse is a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but the LGBT community faces a lot of discrimination.
Because of the country &apos; s conservative values, studies have estimated that between 70 per cent and 90 per cent of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases are due to the failure to use appropriate protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV/AIDS drugs as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of her staff leaked data from Republican senators and says it is "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories."
Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday criticized the allegations that a member of her staff had posted personal information of three Republican senators on Wikipedia pages for legislators.
The Democrat from Los Angeles said those allegations were being driven by right-wing commentators and websites.
Waters tweeted: "Lies, lies and more despicable lies."
The information published allegedly included the addresses and telephone numbers of US Senators Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
On Thursday, an unknown person posted the information on the Internet during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Brett Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court nominee.
The leak occurred sometime after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address associated with the publication was linked to Waters &apos; office and made public the data of a Waters staff member, according to the Capitol.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and a complete lie, Waters continued.
The member of my staff, whose identity, personal data and security have been affected as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations, was not responsible for the leak of this information.
This unfounded allegation is completely false and a complete lie.
Waters &apos; statement was immediately criticized on the Internet, including by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
He wrote, "This information is false, and I am angry about it."
This suggests that the necessary temperance to be a Member of Congress is not there.
When someone is accused of something they did not do, they should not get angry.
Do not rebel.
Do not question the motives of the accuser.
Keep calm and carry on.
Fleischer seemed to be comparing Waters' reaction to the Kavanaugh hearing with the Democrats' criticism of Kavanaugh, who they accused of seeming too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Republican Omar Navarro, who is running against Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
If that is true, that is very serious.
In his statement, Waters said that his office had alerted "relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies to these fraudulent allegations."
We will ensure that the perpetrators are identified and held legally accountable for all these destructive and dangerous acts against all my staff members.
Johnny English: Back in Action. Rowan Atkinson &apos; s parody of the spy falls short
Now it has become a tradition to look for Brexit gags in any new British film. It seems to be what you should do with this new Johnny English parody action and comedy franchise, which started in 2003 with Johnny English and returned in 2011 with Johnny English Returns.
Is this ironic self-satire the new export opportunity for our nation?
Johnny English, with his bulging eyes and expressionless face, has been granted a licence to cock things up for the second time. Just his name gives a clue that this is a comedy aimed at non-English-speaking film territories.
Of course, it is the ridiculous secret agent, despite his odd claims to glamour, who has a little bit of Clouseau, a touch of Mr. Bean and a pinch of that type who touched only one note in the Carrefour de feu ceremony at the London 2012 Olympic Games.
Originally, it was based on the mysterious man traveller and international symbol, which Atkinson had created years ago for Barclaycard TV adverts, causing chaos in its wake.
There are a couple of good moments in this last one.
I loved seeing Johnny English approaching a helicopter dressed in medieval armour as the rotors hit the hull.
Atkinson &apos; s physical comedy is obvious, but the humour is somewhat lacking and is particularly superfluous now that franchises such as 007 and Mission: Impossible are adding comic ingredients without problems.
The humour seems more aimed at children than adults, and for me, the silly adventures of Johnny English are not as clever and well-timed as the silent jokes of Atkinson in the role of Mr. Bean.
Now, the repeated argument of the day is that Britain is in deep trouble.
A computer hacker has infiltrated the super-secret network of British spies, revealing the identities of all active agents to the consternation of Kevin Eldon, who is sadly only a small part of the service.
It is the straw that breaks the camel's back for the Prime Minister, a pompous and cornered character who is seeing his political popularity sink: Emma Thompson gives her best in this role that is almost like Theresa May, but the script leaves little room for working.
His intelligence advisers inform him that, as all active spies are in danger, he will have to rely on one who is retired.
That must be the bumbling Johnny English, who now teaches at a posh private school, but also teaches secret agent skills on the side: there are some good jokes, as it is a spy school similar to Rock School.
English is transferred to Whitehall for an urgent meeting and meets his old pal Bough, again represented by Ben Miller.
Now, Bough is a married man with a submariner captain, a role that Vicki Pepperdine doesn &apos; t exploit enough.
Thus, the terrible Batman and Robin from the Secret Service return to action, with the beautiful and deadly Ophelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is falling into the dangerous claws of a charismatic billionaire from the world of technology who claims he can solve Britain &apos; s IT problems: sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of absurd situations: they disguise themselves as waiters, set fire to a chic French restaurant, cause chaos by hiding on the luxurious yacht of Volta; English also becomes pure anarchy when he tries to use a virtual reality helmet to familiarise himself with the interior of Volta &apos; s house.
They were definitely used to the max in that last sequence, but, however graceful and noisy it may be, the whole thing still has a somewhat childish feel to it.
A fairly regular product.
As with the other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but wonder if the British film industry couldn't give Rowan Atkinson a role that truly does justice to his talent.
The Labour Party denies that it is drawing up a plan to make Britons work four days a week and be paid for five.
The Labour Party under Jeremy Corbyn is going to think about a radical plan that would see Britons working four days a week, but earning five.
The party allegedly wants the owners of companies to allocate the savings from the AI revolution to the workers, giving them an additional day off.
Thus, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend at the same pay.
According to sources, the idea "fits" into the party's economic and political plans to tilt the country in favour of workers.
This change to a four-day week has been supported by Congress of Trade Unions, as it is a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
As a senior Labour Party figure told The Sunday Times: A review of the directive is expected before the end of the year.
The four-day working week is a long-term goal for the party, but it is not something that can be achieved overnight, he said.
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such ideas, as the Green Party had already promised a four-day working week in its campaign for the 2017 general election.
However, not all Labour Party members are in favour of this decision.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "The four-day week is not part of the party's policy and is not going to be discussed at this time."
Shadow chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Party conference last week to outline his idea of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was prepared to recover powers from "anonymous directors" and "opportunistic" directors of public service companies.
One of the shadow minister &apos; s plans also includes the idea that the current shareholders in water companies will not get back all their investment, as a Labour government could apply deductions that correspond to the perceived irregularities.
He also confirmed his intention to include workers on the boards of companies and to create inclusive ownership funds, with 10 per cent of private sector companies &apos; shares going to employees, which would yield annual dividends of up to £500.
Senators Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk to 60 Minutes about the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh and whether it could change their minds
The FBI investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has at least delayed by a week the final vote on his confirmation as a Supreme Court justice, and it also raises the question of whether the results of the investigation could influence any Republican senator who decides to ultimately withdraw his support.
In an interview to be broadcast on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could bring them around.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"Of course," said Kennedy.
I was in favor of going forward with the hearing, I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after all this had happened, after the claim had been made and I asked him: "Did you do it?"
He was firm, resolute, and uncompromising.
Graham's vote, however, seems immovable.
I have already made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh and I would ignore the allegations against him.
Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett Kavanaugh denied it tersely.
And none of the people she named has been able to confirm it.
36 years ago.
It is always the same, I see nothing new in this case."
What is the "Global Citizen Festival"? Has it reduced poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music festival that brings together an impressive lineup of stars for a mission just as impressive: ending poverty in the world.
This year, the seventh edition of the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people moving to Central Park's Great Lawn to enjoy performances by Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of the event: ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international awareness group that aims to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
If you want a free ticket to the event (unless you can afford a VIP ticket), concert attendees have had to complete a series of tasks or "actions," such as volunteering, sending emails to a world leader, making a phone call or any other activity that helps to raise awareness about their goal to end poverty.
However, what has the Global Citizen achieved in 12 years of reaching its goal?
Is the idea of a free concert a genuine way to persuade people to take action or is it just another form of "clicktivism", which is the name given to the attitude we adopt when we think we are doing something really useful by signing a petition online or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has claimed to have registered more than 19 million actions by its supporters in support of a wide range of goals.
Through these actions, they claim to have helped leaders around the world to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which will impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people in 2030.
By early 2018, the group had cited 390 commitments and announcements that resulted from its actions, of which at least $10 billion had been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that the guaranteed funds have directly impacted almost 649 million people around the world.
Among the most important commitments is "The Power of Nutrition", a UK-based investor and implementer partnership, united in the common goal of "helping children grow and develop to their full potential". To this end, $35 million has been proposed to help Rwanda end malnutrition in the country, following more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizen partners.
Thanks to the support of the Government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and partners like you, we can mark a small milestone in the history of social injustice of malnutrition.
The group also said that, after having carried out more than 5,000 actions to improve nutrition for mothers and children in the UK, the government announced the funding of a project, Power of Nutrition, which will benefit 5 million women and children through nutrition-related interventions.
In response to one of the frequent questions asked on their website about what we think can be done to address extreme poverty,
A Global Citizen collaborator responded: "It will be a long and hard road, and we will stumble and fall.
But, as the human rights and anti-apartheid movements have shown, we can achieve our goals if we work together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are some of the acts we will have at the New York event this year, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy to carry out the energy export blockade of Russia - Department of the Interior
In the event that it was necessary, the United States Navy could be called upon to prevent Russian energy from shaking up the markets, including the Middle East, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia &apos; s alliance with Syria, in particular where it operates on behalf of the legitimate government, is just a pretext for expansion into new markets.
I am convinced that they are in the Middle East to negotiate energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, becoming the southernmost supplier of energy to Europe.
In addition, according to official information, there are ways and means of dealing with this issue.
The United States, with its Navy, has the capacity to ensure that maritime routes remain open and, if necessary, could even block them to ensure that energy does not end up on the market.
Zinke addressed the people who attended an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that describes itself as "the voice of the energy consumer in the United States."
In it, he compared the approaches that Washington takes in its negotiations with Russia and Iran, and warned that they are, in fact, the same.
The economic alternative in Iran and Russia is, basically, to exploit and replace fossil fuels, he said, adding that Russia only knows one thing, and that is to base its economy on fossil fuels.
These statements are made when the Trump administration has been trying to push liquefied natural gas exports to Europe and to replace Russia as the cheapest option for European consumers.
To that end, members of the Trump administration, including Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to abandon the "unacceptable" Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which, according to Trump, will turn Berlin into a hostage of Moscow.
Moscow has insisted throughout that the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which has a value of $11 billion and is intended to double the current capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic metres, is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin defends that Washington &apos; s fierce opposition to the project is only motivated by economic interests and is yet another example of unfair competition.
I believe that we all share the idea that energy cannot be turned into a tool of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after a meeting with Rick Perry, the US Secretary of Energy, in Moscow in September.
The United States position has, however, been met with resistance from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The German industry leader, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US not to intervene in EU energy policy or in the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
It is a major problem when a third state interferes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, director of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts senator, will "thoroughly" consider running for president in 2020, she said.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would consider joining the presidential race after the midterm elections.
During a meeting at the Holyoke City Hall in Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that this challenge was being considered.
It is time for women to come to Washington to fix our fractured government and finally have women in leadership roles, according to The Hill.
After November 6, I will seriously consider running for the presidency.
Warren gave her opinion on President Donald Trump during a City Hall appearance and said he was "taking the country down the wrong path."
I really worry about the damage that Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren spoke bluntly about Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet from Friday, Warren said, "It is absolutely necessary that the FBI investigate what happened before the vote."
A poll was released on Thursday, however, a majority of Warren &apos; s own voters do not believe she should run for president in 2020.
A 58 per cent of "likely" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to a Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
32 per cent of those surveyed supported his candidacy.
In the survey, support for former Governor Deval Patrick was 38 per cent for a possible candidacy and 48 per cent against.
Other members of the Democratic Party spoke about the possible candidacy of former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont for the 2020 election.
Biden said he would make a decision in January, as reported by the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about Track Palin &apos; s post-traumatic stress disorder at a Donald Trump rally
Palin, 26, served a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
The situation that my son is going through, everything that has happened since he came home, is very familiar to the families that are suffering the effects of TEPT and other wounds that our soldiers return with, and I spoke to the crowd at a Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin referred to this arrest as the "big taboo nobody wants to talk about," and commented on his son and other veterans of war who "come back with a different attitude, hardened, wondering if there really is that respect for what their fellow soldiers and aviators, as well as all the other members of the military, have given to their country."
On Monday, he was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, on charges of domestic violence, which interfered with a domestic violence complaint and a weapons charge under the influence of drugs or alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 States, D.C. support the challenge to achieve a new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia have filed a lawsuit challenging the new US policy that denies asylum to domestic violence and gang victims.
Representatives from 18 states and the District of Columbia sent a "friendly letter" to Washington on Friday to show their support for a current asylum seeker who is facing the current directive, according to NBC News.
The name of the plaintiff in the "Grace v. Sessions" case, which was filed by the ACLU in August 2017 against the federal government policy, has not been revealed.
He said that his partner "and his children, who are members of a violent gang", abused him, but U.S. officials denied his asylum request on 20 July.
She was arrested in Texas.
The lawyers representing these states, which defend Grace, described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum applications to the United States, as countries facing widespread problems related to domestic violence and gang violence.
The new asylum policy of the United States revoked a 2014 decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) that allowed undocumented domestic violence victims to seek asylum in this country.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine made remarks on Friday in which he said the new policy "ignores decades of international, federal and state law."
According to federal law, all asylum applications must be denied on the basis of the particular facts and circumstances of the claim and this exception violates that principle, as indicated in the amicus curiae brief.
The lawyers also wrote that the policy of denying entry to immigrants hurts the U.S. economy by claiming that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and that they are a necessary workforce.
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to domestic-abuse and gang-violence victims.
Asylum seekers may be granted asylum if they leave their country of origin because of persecution or fear of persecution on the basis of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.
Asylum was never created as a panacea to address all problems, let alone all serious problems, that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the death toll rises in a race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse and worse.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, was trying to comfort her feverish baby at a shelter in the devastated city of Palu.
Every minute ambulances arrive with more bodies.
And clean water is scarce."
Some residents have returned to their destroyed homes in an attempt to salvage what they can from the few belongings that remain.
Hundreds of people are injured and hospitals, also damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake, are overwhelmed.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who has a broken back and shoulder, were resting outside the Army Hospital in Palu, where patients were being treated outside the building due to the continuing aftershocks, which were also very strong.
I couldn't help but cry when he told us about the violent earthquake he experienced while on the 5th floor of the hotel with his wife and daughter.
We had no time to get out of the way.
I was trapped in the rubble of the fallen wall, he told AP. He and his family were in the city to celebrate a wedding.
I heard my wife call for help and then a long silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope you are well."
The US Ambassador to China accuses China of "bullying" with "propaganda announcements"
A week after a Chinese official newspaper published a four-page advertisement in a U.S. newspaper touting the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread its propaganda.
On Wednesday, President Donald Trump referred to the China Daily supplement in the Des Moines Register, the most widely circulated newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of trying to interfere in the November 6 elections in the United States, something China denies vehemently.
Trump &apos; s accusation that Beijing was trying to influence US elections marked a new phase in a growing US campaign to pressure China.
While it is common for foreign governments to publicize their commercial activities, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in a growing trade war that has led both sides to raise tariffs on imports from each other.
The Chinese countervailing duties that were in place at the start of the trade war were designed to fall on exporters in states like Iowa, which supported the Republican Party of Trump, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, one of the largest agricultural exporters to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesspeople.
As Branstad wrote in an opinion piece in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, China is "intensifying that pressure with advertisements in our free press."
To spread its propaganda, the Chinese government is using the cherished American tradition of freedom of expression and a free press by attempting to place a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register.
In contrast, in the newsstand in Beijing where we are now, there are only a few voices of dissent and no real reflection of the diverse opinions that people in China can have about the worrying trajectory that their economy is taking, because the media are controlled by the firm pressure of the Chinese Communist Party.
He added that "one of the most important newspapers in China declined to publish" his article, but did not specify which newspaper.
Analysts say that Republicans are distancing themselves from women before the midterm election with the Kavanaugh debacle
As many prominent Republicans are now rallying behind Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of multiple sexual assault allegations, analysts have warned that a backlash could occur, especially among women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions surrounding this fact have been intense, and many Republicans have said they want to move forward with the vote.
Grant Reeher, a political scientist at Syracuse University, told The Hill on Saturday that "you can't go back" on these issues.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) &apos; s latest attempt to position himself in favor of the FBI &apos; s investigation would be enough to calm voters upset about this issue.
Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday, they are not going to forget tomorrow, and they are not going to forget in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, according to the Washington Post.
On Friday morning, the protesters outside the Senate were singing "November is coming!" (November is coming soon!) as the Republicans on the Judiciary Committee decided to move forward with Kavanaugh's nomination, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to Mic.
Democrats &apos; enthusiasm and motivation are way beyond any prediction, said political analyst Stu Rothenberg, who is non-partisan, to the news site.
People say that the impact is already significant, and that is indeed the case.
But it could be even worse, especially among indecisive women from the outskirts of the city and younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who do not usually vote, even though they do not like the president."
Even before the public testimony of Ford, who detailed in great detail her allegations of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts said a backslide could occur if Republicans pressed ahead with the confirmation.
This has become a big mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, as reported by NBC News earlier this week.
It is no longer just a question of the committee vote and the final vote, or even whether Kavanaugh sits on the bench; it is also about how the Republicans have handled all of this and how they have treated her," said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats.
However, Americans seem to be divided; they do not know whom to believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, but a few more are now on Kavanaugh &apos; s side.
In a new YouGov poll, 41 per cent of respondents said they believed Ford &apos; s testimony, while 35 per cent said they believed Kavanaugh &apos; s testimony.
In addition, 38 per cent said they believed Kavanaugh had lied during his testimony, while 30 per cent said the same of Ford.
The FBI is currently investigating Ford &apos; s statements, as well as at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, as reported by The Guardian.
Ford testified under oath to the Senate Judiciary Committee last week and said that Kavanaugh had raped her while drunk at age 17.
Ramirez claimed that the Supreme Court nominee showed him his genitals at a party when he was a student at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is considering starting a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a new company that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt is the last project of the technology legend. A company that is based on the open-source platform of the Solid of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and who will have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intent behind Inrupt was "to rule the world."
He said, "It has to be now."
It is a historic moment.
The application uses Solid technology to allow users to create their own "personal data storage online" or a POD.
It may contain lists, lists of pending tasks, the calendar, the music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like having Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all available in one browser and at the same time.
Something that is unique to online personal data storage is that the user is the one who decides completely who can access what type of information.
The company calls it "personal training through data."
The idea behind Inrupt, according to the company's chief executive officer, John Bruce, is to integrate resources, processes and skills to enable Solid to reach the world.
The company is currently made up of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform IBM bought, some of the in-house developers who were hired to work on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week, developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that his team was not talking to Facebook and Google about whether a "radical change" was going to be introduced, where all their business models would be completely changed overnight.
We are not going to ask permission.
In a Medium post on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote about Inrupt, "Its mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web created in Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last few months, Berners-Lee has had a very influential role in the debate over net neutrality.
Even with Inrupt launched, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
Berners-Lee was "incredibly optimistic about the next era of the web"
Bernard Vann: the vicar who won a Victoria Cross in the First World War
The only Church of England clergyman to win a Victoria Cross during the First World War has been honoured in his home town 100 years later.
Lieutenant-Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded this decoration on 29 September 1918 at the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, a sniper killed him four days later and he never knew that he had been awarded the highest military honour in Britain.
On Saturday, his two grandchildren found a commemorative stone in a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of them, Michael Vann, said it was "a very symbolic thing" that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after the battle that earned his grandfather the medal.
According to the London Gazette, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a dense fog and under intense machine-gun and artillery fire".
He then ran to the line of fire and, with the "greatest courage", advanced the line before reaching a single-barrelled gun with one hand and knocking out three of the enemy.
Lt. Col. Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, just one month after the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather &apos; s actions were &quot; so big that I will never be able to reach that level, but they were very instructive.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid a wreath after the parade, which was accompanied by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said it was a privilege for him to be able to take part in the parade and added that the value of a true hero was clear when so much support was shown.
MMA followers stayed up all night for Bellator 206, but all they saw was Peppa Pig
Imagine that you stay up all night to watch Bellator 206 and at the end they don't let you see the main event.
The San Jose poster had 13 fights, six of which were on the main card, and it was going to be broadcast live in the UK on Channel 5 at night.
At 6 a.m. as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face off, the UK viewers were left stunned when the programme changed to Peppa Pig.
Some people were not surprised after having to stay up until the early hours of the morning just to see the fight.
One Twitter follower described the change to animated drawings as "a heavy joke".
There is a government regulation that governs what is broadcast after 6 a.m. and that was not appropriate, so they had to change the children's programming schedule," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice-president of marketing and communications at Bellator, when asked about the broadcast.
""Peppa the pig", yes."
Bellator president Scott Coker said they would be changing the format to include British fans in future shows.
When I think about the option of live streaming, I think it could work," said Coker.
But it is 6 a.m. on a Sunday, so we could not do it until Sunday at our time, which would be Monday for them.
We are working on it.
Believe me, when the schedule changed, we received a lot of messages, and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to fix it, because at first we thought it was a technical problem.
But it was not, it was a government problem.
I can promise you that it will not happen again.
We will reduce it to five fights instead of six, which is what we normally do. We tried to give more than usual to make the fans happy and we went over.
That is a very unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior about his sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior because of his sexuality, but that was what drove him to become a champion.
At 24, he told us that he did not realize that not everyone was like him until he went to secondary school.
In the first Desert Island Discs programme on Radio 4, presented by Lauren Laverne, she said her intention in talking about gay rights was to "transmit hope" to others.
He also told us that becoming a father made him start to downplay the importance of winning at the Olympics.
The regular presenter of this legendary show, Kirsty Young, will be absent for a few months due to illness.
In the first episode of Laverne, Daley, who had been a social outcast, said that he had felt "inferior" to others during his childhood because "it was not socially acceptable to like children and girls."
She said: "Until today, that feeling of inferiority and being different has been what has really given me the power and the strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something", so he didn't disappoint when he finally discovered his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medal winner has become a prominent figure in the LGBT movement and his image has been used in the Commonwealth Games held in Australia this year to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he told his story because he felt fortunate to live in freedom, without reprisals, and wanted to pass on that "hope" to others.
The three-time world champion said that for him, too, it was a surprise to fall in love with a man, the American film director Dustin Lance Black, whom she met in 2013.
Daley married last year the Oscar winner, who is 20 years his senior, but he said that the age difference had never been an issue.
When you live so much from such a young age (she was 14 when she first competed at the Olympics and her father died of cancer three years later), it is hard to find someone your own age who has experienced the same highs and lows as you.
The couple had a son in June whom they named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said his "global perspective" had changed.
If I had been asked last year, all the answers would have been about "I have to win a gold medal."
But you know what, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is, without a doubt, Robbie."
His son is named Robert, after his father, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was going to die, and in fact one of the last things he asked was whether they had London 2012 tickets, because he wanted to be in the front row.
I couldn't tell him I couldn't be in the front row," he said.
He had his hand in mine when he stopped breathing and it was only at that precise moment that I realized that he was not invincible.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
At that moment I knew that was what I had dreamed of all my life: competing in the pool in front of my family at the Olympics, there was nothing better.
This was also the inspiration behind his first song choice, Proud, by Heather Small, which accompanied him during the preparation for the Olympic Games.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, in poor form, sat on the bench during the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to reverse his form if he wants to avoid becoming a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who was playing in the biennial event to try to set a record for the 12th time, was replaced by Furyk for the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being in the middle of the action, as he has so often been for the United States, the five-time major champion had to cheer on at times and, at others, try to perfect his game on the field and thus be able to correct what ails him.
Never the most direct of drivers, even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old is not in his best form for the long rough at Le Golf National, where errant shots are punished continually.
And, if the field is not sufficiently discouraging, Mickelson, in the ninth round on Sunday, faces the brilliant champion of the British Open, Francesco Molinari, who has joined debutant Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches they have played this week.
If the Americans, who were four points behind after the first 12 individual matches, had started in such an impressive fashion, Mickelson's match might have been decisive.
Furyk showed confidence in his partner, and could not say much more.
He understood perfectly the role he played today, gave me a pat on the back and said he would be ready for tomorrow."
He has a lot of self-confidence.
He is in the Hall of Fame and has contributed a lot to these teams before and this week.
I probably wouldn't have imagined playing two games.
I thought there would be more, but that is how it came out and that is how we think it should be.
He wants to be there, like the rest of us."
On Sunday, Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record of most matches played in the Ryder Cup.
It could be the last of a Ryder Cup career that had never been so clearly defined by his individual brand.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and 7 ties, but Furyk said his presence added many more intangible values to the team.
It was fun, sarcastic, clever, he liked to mock others; it was great to have him on the team.
I think the younger players have really enjoyed having him as a support, and this week as well; it was fun.
It goes beyond just playing games.
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows that leadership can disappear very quickly
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows only too well that, even with a substantial advantage in the final days of the Ryder Cup, it can easily become an uncomfortable tournament.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where Seve Ballesteros &apos; s European team led by one point over the Americans, but in the end only managed to finish them off by a minimum margin, winning 14½-13½.
You keep reminding me that we won a great tournament at Valderrama, we also won at Brookline and lost, we won at Valderrama and lost, but by a whisker," said Bjorn, pictured, after seeing the 2018 generation win 5-3 on Friday and lead by 10-6 yesterday at Le Golf National.
History will teach me and the world that that team is not finished.
You have to give it your all tomorrow.
Get out there and do what you have to do.
This does not end until the points are on the board.
We have a goal to achieve, and that is to win this trophy, and that is all we need to think about.
I say it all the time, we focus on our 12 players, but we are very aware of what is on the other side where they are, and that they are the best players in the world."
Proud of what his players had achieved on a very difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I don't want to go too far ahead.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
What is different tomorrow is the individual actions and this is different.
It is great to share the good times with a partner, but when things are not going well, you are really tested as a golfer.
The message that needs to be sent to the players is to give their best tomorrow morning.
Now it is time to leave your partner behind and go and get the best out of yourself."
Facing Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will try to get his players to play better individually than they did as a team, with the exceptions of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who added four points.
Furyk has been on both ends of the spectrum in the last few days of those big tournaments, and was part of the team that won at Brookline and then lost when Europe pulled off the "Miracle at Medinah".
I remember every word," he said when we asked him how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, managed to motivate his players on the last day.
We have 12 super-importants tomorrow, but we have to play as well as we did in Brookline, as you saw in Medinah.
When we all move in the same direction, the pressure falls on those middle parties.
We defined our strategy and made them feel like we were going to do something magical tomorrow.
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the fight and face Rory McIlroy in the main event, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the second half of the list.
I went with this group of boys in this order because I think they cover the whole route," said Bjorn on his individual selections.
The new German warship, delayed again
The new German Navy frigate was supposed to replace the old Cold War-era vessels in 2014, but it will not be commissioned until at least next year due to defective systems and the increasing costs, local media reported.
The delivery of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the lead ship of the new Baden-Württemberg class of frigates, has been postponed now until the first half of 2019, according to a report in the newspaper Die Zeit, citing a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to have joined the Navy in 2014, but problems that arose after delivery scuppered the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships that the Navy requested in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
We know that they will include a powerful cannon, a set of anti-aircraft missiles and some stealth technologies, such as radar, infrared and acoustic signatures that are very low.
Among other important features are longer maintenance periods, allowing deployment up to two years away from the home port.
However, the constant delays have meant that the innovative ships (which were supposed to allow Germany to project its power into the far reaches of the world) will already be out of date when they start service, as Die Zeit points out.
The unfortunate F125 frigate was taken over last year, when the German Navy officially rejected the idea of putting the ship into service and returned it to Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time a ship has been returned to a shipyard after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind the return, but German media cited a number of "critical software and hardware defects" that left the ship practically useless if sent on a combat mission.
Software deficiencies were particularly important, as the class Baden-Württemberg ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors: half the crew of the old class Bremen frigates.
It was also found that the ship was overweight, which reduced its performance and limited the Navy &apos; s ability to add future updates.
It is believed that the 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is twice as heavy as other similar German ships used in World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the overall project cost, including crew training, has also been a problem.
It is believed that the figure has now reached 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion), rather than the initial 2.2 billion euros.
The problems being assigned to the new frigates are of particular significance in the light of recent warnings about the reduction of the German navy.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the defence committee of the German parliament, admitted that the Navy was "running out of ships capable of deploying".
The official said the problem had been getting worse over time, because old ships had been decommissioned but not replaced.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Württemberg class frigates had been able to join the Navy.
The National Trust spies on the secret lives of bats
This new research, carried out in the Highlands of Scotland, is trying to find out how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
It is hoped that what is learned will shed more light on the behaviour of the only flying mammals and help to guide future conservation activities.
The study, carried out by the National Trust for Scotland, will follow common and soprano bats, as well as Daubenton's and long-eared bats in the gardens of Inverewe in Wester Ross.
Special bat detectors will be placed strategically on the property to monitor bat activity during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also be conducting mobile investigations using portable detectors.
Expert analysis of the sounds recorded on the recordings will help to determine the frequency of calls from bats and the species that make them.
A report and map of the habitat will be produced to provide a detailed picture of the environment and its behaviour.
Rob Dewar, a nature conservation adviser for NTS, is hoping that the results will show which areas of the habitat are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
With this information, the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of meadows and how to maintain forests for bats and other associated species, will be determined.
The populations of bats in Scotland and the United Kingdom have declined considerably over the last century.
They are under threat from construction and development that affect their nests and habitat.
Wind turbines and electrical cabling can also pose a risk to them, as can insecticides and other chemical treatments of construction materials or attacks by domestic cats.
Bats are not really blind,
Otherwise, due to their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes in achieving their goal.
They use a sophisticated technique of ecolocation to locate ants and obstacles on their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes the issue of bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts who regularly conduct surveys, nest inspections and, on occasion, rescues.
The organisation has even opened the first and only Scottish bat reserve at Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten species of Scottish bat.
The property manager, David Thompson, says it is the ideal territory for them.
Here, at Threave, we have a fantastic area for bats," he said.
We have old buildings, many veteran trees and the right habitat.
However, there are still many unknowns about bats, so the work we do here and at other properties will help us to understand better what they need to develop.
It is important to check for bats before undertaking maintenance work within properties, as this could destroy a breeding colony and kill 400 females and pups, which would wipe out an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or destroy their colonies.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, has urged the public to help.
He said: "We still have a lot to learn about bats and many other species on which we do not know how their populations are evolving."
Ronaldo denies rape allegations while his lawyers pursue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has dismissed rape allegations as "fake news" and said people were "trying to get their name in the papers" at his expense.
His lawyers have been instructed to file a complaint against the German magazine Der Spiegel, where the statements were published.
The forward of Portugal and Juventus is accused of raping a woman from the United States, called Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He is accused of having paid $375,000 to keep the incident secret, according to Der Spiegel on Friday.
With a video on Instagram Live that has already amassed 142 million followers just hours after the news was released, Ronaldo, 33, dismissed the report as "fake news".
No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false", says five-time winner of the Golden Ball, looking at the camera.
They just want publicity at my expense.
It's the same old story.
They want to be famous just by mentioning me, but I can't help it.
I am a happy man and everything is fine," he added, smiling.
Ronaldo &apos; s lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against Der Spiegel over the allegations in what they called &quot; an unacceptable intrusion into the sphere of privacy &quot;, Reuters reported.
Christian Schertz, the player &apos; s lawyer, said the player would seek compensation for &quot; moral damages in an amount that corresponds to the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of his personal rights in recent years &quot;.
According to reports, the incident occurred in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After allegedly meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga went to the player &apos; s room, where Ronaldo, allegedly, raped her anally, according to the documents filed in the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga said Ronaldo knelt after the incident and told him that he was "99 per cent" a "good kid" and that he had let him down by "one per cent."
In the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that they took photographs of her injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "afraid of retaliation" and worried about being "humiliated in public".
The woman, 34, claims she is trying to annul the agreement, as she is still traumatised by the events.
When the alleged attack took place, Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United and this summer he has moved to Juventus, a big name in Italian football for a 100 million euro contract.
Brexit: The UK will always regret losing car manufacturers
The UK would "regret it all our lives" if we lost our position as the world's leading car manufacturer after Brexit, said the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, Greg Clark.
He added that it was "concerning" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that, if Britain left the EU without a deal, production at its Burnaston factory near Derby would be temporarily halted.
Mr. Clark said, "We need an agreement."
The Japanese manufacturer said that the impact of delays at UK customs in the event of a no-deal Brexit could result in job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which makes Toyota Auris and Avensis models, produced 150,000 cars last year, of which 90 per cent were exported to the rest of the European Union.
My view is that if Britain leaves the EU in March, there will be production bottlenecks at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, the general manager of Toyota Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers have expressed concerns about the impact of leaving the EU without a deal, especially in relation to cross-border trade; including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW has said it will close its Oxford Mini plant a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of the car manufacturers relate to the problems that could arise in the event of a no-deal Brexit in the assembly lines.
Toyota &apos; s production line is based on the &quot; just in time &quot; method, where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and EU to build cars to order.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be a disruption at the border, according to the sector, which could lead to delays and component shortages.
Toyota said it would be impossible to house the equivalent of a day's inventory in its Derbyshire plant and production would be halted if that happened.
Mr Clark said that Theresa May &apos; s Chequers plan, which sets out future relations with the EU, was &quot; calibrated precisely to avoid these controls at the border &quot;.
We need an agreement. We want the best agreement that not only will allow us to get through this moment but we have to take advantage of the opportunity."
Toyota, among others, has evidence that we have to be able to continue with what, so far, has been a very successful supply chain.
Toyota has not been able to say for how long production would be halted, but warned that, in the long term, the added costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and, ultimately, the costs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at the plant for 24 years and is the Unite union representative there, said his members were increasingly concerned: "According to my experience, once those jobs are lost, they never come back."
A government spokesman said: "We have put in place a clear and convincing plan for our future relationship with the EU."
The Trump-Rosenstein meeting could be delayed again, according to the White House
The high-risk meeting between President Donald Trump and the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein could be delayed another week, the White House said Sunday, as the fight over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continued.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election, connections between Trump campaign and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The expectation that Trump would fire the deputy attorney general or not, and thus compromise the independence of Mueller, has fueled the Washington gossip mill for months.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein recorded his conversations with Trump with a microphone he carried himself in an attempt to remove the president via the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied that.
However, on Monday, he went to the White House, where news reports said he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump (who was then in New York at the United Nations) was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he "would prefer not to" fire Rosenstein but the meeting was postponed to avoid a conflict with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to investigate the allegations against Kavanaugh for a week, which would delay the full Senate vote.
Trump press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, he said: "No date has been set, it could be this week or it could be postponed, considering all that is happening with the Supreme Court."
We will decide on the spot and I will be reporting to the press as I usually do.
Some journalists would dispute that assertion: Sanders has not held a press briefing at the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked what the reasons were.
Sanders said the shortage of press passes was not due to a dislike of TV reporters who act with bombast, but he said: "I won't disagree with the fact that they fanfaronade."
She then suggested that the direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
The President holds more question-and-answer sessions than any other President before him, he said, citing "unsubstantiated numbers."
Press briefings will continue, Sanders said, but "if the press has the option of asking directly the President of the United States, I think that is much better than asking me."
We have tried to do this many times and you have seen us do this many times in the last few weeks, so this would replace a press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump usually responds to questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in public events or press briefings with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences with him are very rare.
In fact, this week, in New York, the President demonstrated why that was so, where he made an unannounced and, at times, bizarre appearance before the assembled press.
The Scottish Government Health Secretary writes to NHS Scotland staff about their fears over Brexit
The Department of Health and Social Care has written to the EU staff working in the Scottish HSCI to express the gratitude of the country and its wish for them to continue working with them after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter just six months before the UK leaves the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to cover the cost of citizenship applications for EU nationals working in non-central government services.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote: &quot; During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on the exit continued, with decisions expected this autumn.
However, the UK government has also stepped up preparations for a possible scenario in which there is no agreement.
I know this must be very confusing for you.
And that is why I would like to reiterate how much I value the contribution of each and every member of the staff, regardless of nationality.
The expertise and skills of professionals from across the EU and other countries are invaluable and help to strengthen and improve the work of the health service, which benefits patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is, without a doubt, your home and we would love to continue to have you here.
Christian Abercrombie is undergoing urgent surgery after suffering a head injury
Christion Abercrombie, a player on the Tennessee State Tigers, was treated for a head injury in an emergency operation after suffering a head injury in a 31-27 loss to Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, according to Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee State coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the break.
He came to the band and collapsed there and then.
Both the trainers and the medical staff administered oxygen to Abercrombie on the sideline before placing him on a stretcher and taking him to be examined in depth.
A member of the staff at the Tennessee State Hospital told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there were no details yet on the type of injury or the damage caused" and the Tennessee State was trying to find out when it happened.
Abercrombie, a sophomore, is playing in his first season with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He made five tackles on Saturday before leaving the field, adding 18 tackles for the season.
Foreign buyers will pay a higher stamp duty when they buy a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will pay a higher stamp duty when they buy a property in the UK and the extra money raised will be used to provide shelter for the homeless, according to the new plans of the Conservatives.
The change will neutralize the success of Corbyn's offensive to attract younger voters
The increase in the rate of land transfer tax will apply to those who are not paying taxes in the UK.
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year, which will be used to help the homeless.
The additional money raised from the increase in stamp duty for overseas buyers of UK property would be used to help the homeless, Theresa May said today.
The measure is seen as an attempt to neutralise the success that Jeremy Corbyn is having with his promises to provide more affordable housing to attract younger voters and to target those with higher incomes.
The increase in the rate of stamp duty on land will be levied on people and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK and that money will be used to incentivise the government &apos; s policy to combat begging on the streets.
The levy, which is an additional charge on the current stamp duty, including the increase in rates introduced two years ago on second-hand homes and the "buy-to-let" system, could reach up to 3 per cent.
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year from this change.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of new build properties in London are bought by people who do not live in the UK, which is causing house prices to rise and making it harder for first-time buyers to get on the housing ladder.
Many of the country's wealthiest areas (especially the capital) have become "ghost cities" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in stamp duty to help young people buy their first home.
He accused the big builders of keeping property prices artificially high by buying up land without any intention of using it, and urged Mrs May to scrap the affordable housing charges that were being applied to affordable homes in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn has announced a series of very attractive housing reforms, including rent controls and an end to no-fault evictions.
He also proposes giving local authorities more powers to build new homes.
The Prime Minister said: "Last year I said that I would dedicate my time as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream of improving the lives of every new generation."
That means solving the housing market, which is so badly damaged.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not right that people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as foreign companies, can buy homes more easily than the British working class.
The dream of owning a home has become too difficult for many people and the humiliation of having to sleep on the street is still too real."
Jack Ross: "My primary objective is to lead Scotland"
The Sunderland coach says his "primary objective" is to become Scotland manager at some point.
The 42-year-old Scot is excited by the prospect of reviving the north-east club, which currently occupies third place in the League One (English third division), three points behind the leader.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St. Mirren back into the Scottish Premier League last season.
I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
But I only managed to get a B cap, he told Sportsound on BBC Scotland.
But I grew up watching Scotland at Hampden with my father, and that is something that has always made me want to go back.
That opportunity will only become a reality, however, if I can successfully run a club."
Among the predecessors of Ross as Sunderland manager are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paolo Di Canio.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic says he did not feel any fear when he went to a club with such established names and after rejecting offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
For me, success is measured by whether I can get this club back into the Premier League.
because the structure and facilities of this club are clearly Premier League standard," he said.
It is not easy to get, but I would only consider that I had achieved my goal here when I could return the club to where it belongs.
Ross has only been a coach for three years, after being an assistant at Dumbarton and a 15-month spell in the Hearts technical department.
He helped the Alloa recover from relegation to the Third Division and helped St. Mirren go from being on the brink of relegation to winning the championship the following season.
In fact, Ross says he feels more comfortable now than ever before during his career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
It was probably a real crossroads when I took over the Alloa.
I always thought that direction was what I was best at, much more than playing.
It sounds strange, because it was good, I could make a living at it and I had some epic moments.
But playing can be very hard.
You have to deal with a lot of things every week.
I still suffer from the stress and pressure of that work, but I feel good in my new role.
I always wanted to train and now I have, this is the time of my adult life when I have felt best, without a doubt."
You can hear the full interview on Sportsound on Monday, 30 September, between 12:00 and 13:00 BST.
According to a survey, the perfect time for a pint is 5.30 p.m. on a Saturday.
The heatwave of summer has boosted takings for struggling British pubs, but has concentrated all the pressure on restaurant chains.
Pub and bar groups saw sales rise by 2.7 per cent in July, while restaurant sales fell by 4.8 per cent, according to the figures.
Peter Martin, of CGA, which compiled the figures, said: "The heat of these days and the fact that England is still in the World Cup have meant that July has continued the pattern of June, when pubs increased 2.8 per cent on their takings, while restaurants have fallen even more.
The 1.8 per cent fall in restaurant trade in June was even worse in July.
The pubs and bars that serve mainly drinks had their best month, compared to most restaurants, where profits were down.
The pubs that mainly serve food also suffered, but not to the same extent as restaurants.
It seems that people only want to get out to drink.
In managed bars and pubs, sales of drinks rose by 6.6 per cent during the month, while food sales fell by 3 per cent.
Paul Newman, a hospitality and leisure analyst at RSM, said: "These results follow the trend we have seen since the end of April."
The time and impact of major social or sporting events remain the most significant factors in terms of sales in the home-based activities market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups are still fighting, even though the 4.8 per cent drop in sales compared with last year is going to be particularly painful given the continuing cost pressures.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for the food operators and time will tell whether the more moderate temperatures we have had in August will provide the relief they need.
Total sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, rose 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slow decline in brand openings.
In Coffer Peach Tracker, which monitors sales in the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector, data is collected and analysed for 47 operational groups, with a combined turnover of over £9 billion and is the market reference point.
One in five children have secret social media accounts that their parents are unaware of
One in five children (some as young as 11) have secret social media accounts that their parents and teachers do not know about, according to a survey
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students found a rise in Instagram fake accounts
News has heightened fears of the publication of sexual content
20 per cent of students said they had a "main" account that they showed their parents
One in five children (some as young as 11) have created secret social media accounts that hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed the rapid growth of fake Instagram accounts, a site for sharing photos.
News reports have heightened fears of the publication of sexual content.
20 per cent of students said they had a "main" account that they showed their parents, while having other private accounts.
A mother who stumbled upon her 13-year-old daughter &apos; s secret site was confronted by a teenager who was encouraging others to &quot; rape me &quot;.
Research by the Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters" and Headmistresses" Conference (HMC) of independent schools found that 40 per cent of children aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, and half admitted to having private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, director of HMC, said: "It is alarming that so many young people feel the need to create spaces on the Internet where their parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" on the board of the Scottish Athletics Federation
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the board of the Scottish Athletics Federation as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated athlete on both track and field and Ian Beattie, the president of the Scottish Athletics Federation, described the change as a great opportunity for those who want sport to benefit from its great international experience over the past decade.
Eilidh is recognised and respected throughout the Scottish athletics community, the United Kingdom and the world, and we are sure that Scottish athletics will benefit enormously from her involvement in its leadership.
Doyle said: "I like to be the voice of the athletes and I hope to be able to contribute things and help to develop sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics in four hours and is now a regular expert on the BBC, suffered a transient ischemic attack that left him unable to walk.
He wrote on Twitter: "One month ago, I suffered a stroke.
He could not walk.
According to the doctors, only time would tell whether I would recover or how much I would recover.
It was exhausting, but I recovered completely, I had to learn to walk again and I am now doing agility exercises.

The announcement of the breast pump vending machine, which compares mothers to cows, has divided opinion on the Internet
A breast-pumping company has divided opinion on the Internet with an ad that compares breastfeeding mothers to cows being milked.
To mark the launch of what is supposedly the "world's first silent breast pump", consumer technology company Elvie released an ad inspired by a video with a bit of irony, showing mothers counting the freedom they get from the new breast pump.
Four real women dance in a hay barn, with cows, to the tune of: "Yes, I do it myself, but I don't have a tail" and "Just in case you haven't noticed, they're not udders, they're my breasts."
The chorus continues: "Shoot them, shoot them, I am feeding their babies, shoot them, shoot them, I am milking my women."
However, the announcement, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, has caused a great deal of controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received reactions from all kinds of people who have seen it, with many saying that it focuses on the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
A very unfortunate decision to put cows out to advertise this product.
Just like us, they have to get pregnant before they can produce milk, except that they take their babies away from them just after they give birth.
The Elvie breast pump is discreetly incorporated into a nursing bra (Elvie/Mother).
Another person commented: "Traumatic for the mother and the baby.
But why not use them to announce a breast pump for mothers who do stay with their babies?"
Another comment was: "What a crazy announcement."
However, others defended the announcement, including a woman who admitted that the song was "disturbing."
I think that is a great idea.
If I was still breastfeeding, I would definitely have one.
Using the bomb, I felt like a cow.
The announcement is a bit over the top, but I don &apos; t give it any more thought.
It was a great product, a woman told us.
Another person said: "It is a funny announcement aimed at mothers who use a breast pump (sometimes at work or in public toilets), which makes them feel like cows."
The announcement neither praises nor condemns the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, the women show that they have been dancing with the discreet bombs placed inside the brassieres.
The campaign concept is based on the perception that many women who express milk with a pump say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes, and is discreetly attached to a nursing bra, making it possible for users to move, hold their babies and even go out with the pump in operation.
Ana Balarin, Mother ECD and social partner, comments: &quot; The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By showing the parallel between expressive women and milk cows, we wanted to draw attention to the use of breast pumps and their challenges, while demonstrating the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump offers.
This is not the first time Elvie has made the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two children walked the runway for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of unaccompanied minors discreetly moved to a camp on the Texas border
The number of unaccompanied minors in custody has increased significantly, despite the monthly inflow at the border remaining at near-normal levels.
Traditionally, most sponsors, who were also undocumented immigrants at the time, feared that their willingness to take in a child would jeopardize their own stay in the country.
This risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult family members would have to submit their fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration government agencies.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a high-ranking official at the Department of Homeland Security, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had sought to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested had no criminal records.
Around 80 per cent of sponsors or their family members are in the country illegally, and a large number of them are criminal immigrants.
Therefore, we are still pursuing these individuals," said Albence.
In their haste to process juveniles more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a maximum of one month from the date of arrest, rather than 60 days, as was the previous norm, according to shelter workers.
Many of them will testify by videoconference, rather than in person, to defend their legal status before an immigration judge.
Those who are not considered eligible for asylum will be deported as soon as possible.
According to reports from the centres and the system itself, the longer they are held in custody, the greater the likelihood that they will suffer from anxiety or depression, which could lead to violent outbursts or attempts to escape.
As defenders point out, these concerns are even more pronounced in larger facilities, such as Tornillo, where it is more likely that children will be overlooked due to the size of the facility.
In addition, the move to the camp without having given them enough time to emotionally prepare or to say goodbye to their friends could cause them further trauma, which many are already suffering.
Syria calls on the "occupying forces" of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that the country's war has been going on for its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also the vice-prime minister, said that foreign forces were illegally in Syrian territory under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that the matter would be dealt with accordingly.
They must be withdrawn immediately and unconditionally, he said to the assembly.
Moualem stressed that the "war on terrorism in Syria is practically over", where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have been uprooted from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue to "fight this sacred battle until we cleanse all Syrian territories of terrorists and any foreign illegal presence."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, primarily providing training and advising to the Syrian Kurdish and Arab forces that are opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in this war-ravaged country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said that the conditions were right for them to return and blamed "some Western countries" for "sowing irrational fears" that made refugees decide to stay away.
We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.
The United States and the European Union have already warned that they will not help with the reconstruction of Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a de-escalation zone in the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib has created an opportunity to force political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey averted a large-scale assault on Syrian and Russian forces in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem has made clear that the agreement had "clear timelines" and expressed the hope that the military action would focus on the jihadists, including the Nusra Front fighters, who would be "eliminated".
Staffan de Mistura, the UN special envoy, is hoping to convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to draft a post-conflict constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set out the conditions for Syrian government participation in the committee, arguing that the panel's work should be limited to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and warned against any interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to this logic, Trump would win re-election in 2020, unless, as many liberal viewers surely expect, a resignation or scandal ends his presidency prematurely.
This would surely be "the most dramatic end to a presidency ever!"
There are no signs of fatigue among the spectators at the moment.
Since 2014, the ratings for CNN and MSNBC during the peak audience hours have more than doubled, from 1.05 million to 2.1 million and from 1.6 million to 3.1 million, respectively.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in the prime-time audience, compared with 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and "The Rachel Maddow Show" on MSNBC has surpassed cable news channel ratings with 3.5 million viewers for its prime-time news programs.
“It’s an odd attraction that we still don’t understand,” says Neal Baer, executive producer of “Designated Survivor,” a dramatic series on a Cabinet secretary who becomes president after a Capitol attack.
Veteran comedy writer Nell Scovell has another theory.
He recalled a trip he took in a taxi in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The taxi driver told him he would vote for Trump.
Why?
"Because it makes me laugh," was the response Scovell received.
Chaos is always at a high level in the entertainment world.
Obviously, and unlike everything else that is seen on television, the arguments coming out of Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, the possibility of families of immigrants being able to reunite, or the health of the global economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the privileged few can afford.
However, the information overload comes when you realize that you have been watching a panel of experts debating the use of "deep background" sources that Bob Woodward used for his book "Fear", the $15,000 ostrich-leather jacket of Paul Manafort ("a piece of over-the-top vanity", in the words of The Washington Post), and the implications of Stormy Daniels's lurid descriptions of Trump's anatomy.
As far as I am concerned, I will never look at Mario the same way again.
“By offering something new every night, it is partly what makes everything seem like a reality show,” says Brent Montgomery, executive producer of “Pawn Stars” and creator of “Pawn Stars,” when he talks about the show’s alternating Trump and daily storylines (whether it’s fighting the NFL or praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss an episode if you don't want to fall behind.
When I spoke to Mr. Fleiss this week, it was a sunny 27 degrees on the north shore of Kauai, but he was holed up inside watching MSNBC and CNN at the same time.
He could not tear himself away from the television, not with Brett Kavanaugh ready to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging by a thread.
I remember when we were doing all those crazy things with our programs and people were saying that this was the beginning of the end of Western civilization.
I thought it was all a joke, but in the end they were right.

Foreign money flows into the most tightly contested midterm elections in the House of Representatives
It is no surprise that the influx of money is coming to the 17th District of Pennsylvania, thanks to the redistricting of a congressional district with two candidates seeking re-election to the same seat.
This residential district of Pittsburgh, which recently underwent a redesign, is represented by Democrat Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Republican Keith Rothfus is Lamb &apos; s opponent for re-election, having represented the old 12th District of Pennsylvania, which overlaps significantly with the new 17th.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts had been gerrymandered unconstitutionally in favor of Republicans.
The race for the new 17 has sparked a funding war between the major financial arms of the parties, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC).
The name of Lamb became very familiar in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a special election held in March for the 18th Congressional District.
That seat had been occupied by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts have given Democrats a slight edge.
The United States considered penalizing El Salvador for its support of China, although it later backed down
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with a slight Washington rebuff.
Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and stayed at a hotel in Panama until the partners of the Organization Trump evicted the management team.
State Department officials decided to recall the chiefs of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to "recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan," State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement this month.
But only El Salvador was sanctioned, having already received around $140 million in US assistance in 2017 for, among other things, combating drug trafficking, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts in financial assistance and restrictions on certain visa categories, would have been very painful for Central America and its high unemployment and crime rates.
As the internal meetings progressed, the U.S. and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar meeting held last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent emigration to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior officials in the administration made clear that their intention was to see the conference go ahead, which put an end to any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is expected to speak at the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October and which, according to diplomats, is seen as a sign of the importance the administration has placed on the meeting.
The three American envoys returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without further threats or reprisals from Washington.
A spokesman for the White House in Washington, D.C., declined to comment on the details of the debate described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations on condition of anonymity.
His explanations were corroborated by an external analyst close to the administration, who also spoke under condition of anonymity.
History study
The next step could be the special counsel Robert Mueller &apos; s report on possible obstruction of justice by Trump, which is already evident in the public record.
Mueller is also reportedly looking into the possibility that Trump's campaign was working in parallel with Russia on its election attack.
If the Congress changes hands, Trump will be held accountable by that chamber, just as he is preparing to run for a second term and perhaps ultimately before a jury of his peers.
This is a lot of ifs, and I am not suggesting that Trump's fall is inevitable, nor that his European counterparts will fall.
We will all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will have an impact on the length of the conflict.
In 1938, the German officers were ready to stage a coup against Hitler. All that was needed was for the West to have stood up to him and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The history of the world has turned on these points of inflection, and the inexorable march of democracy accelerates or slows down.
Americans are now facing several of these tipping points.
What if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of the Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a good place since this paper reported last year that he had suggested secretly recording the president and speculating about his inability to serve.
Rosenstein says The Times explanation is not quite right.
How will we respond if the new FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and perjury?
On top of all that, will we vote in midterm elections for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, we will be facing a long winter for democracy.
But thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague, I believe we will not fail.
My mother was a Czech Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had once occupied my ambassador &apos; s house.
He survived, emigrated to the United States, and 60 years later, he sent me to light Sabbath candles on the same table decorated with a swastika.
With that legacy, how could I not be optimistic about our future?

Graham Dorrans, Rangers, optimistic ahead of Rapid Vienna match
The Rangers will play at home on Thursday against Rapid Vienna, knowing that a win over the Austrians, after the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal at the start of the month, will put them in a strong position to qualify for the Europa League Group G.
A knee injury prevented Rangers midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season in the 2-2 draw at Villarreal, but he believes the team can use that result as a springboard for bigger things.
We got a good point out of it, because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old player.
We started the game believing we could do something and ended up with a point.
Perhaps we could have won in the end, but overall the draw was perhaps a fair result.
They were better in the first half, but after the break we came out fighting and we were the better team.
This Thursday we will have another great European night.
I hope we can achieve the three points, but it will be a tough game because they got a good result in the previous game. But with the whole crowd behind us, I am sure we can get a positive result.
Last year was definitely tough with my injuries and the changes in the club, but now there is a general feeling that everything will be all right.
The team is well, the boys are having a great time and we are getting a good workout.
I hope we can move forward, leave last year behind and achieve success.
The fear of retirement is keeping some women awake at night
Despite the fact that the survey respondents had a clear idea of how they wanted to be treated, few people talk about this with their families.
Around half of the people who participated in Nationwide &apos; s study said they talked to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 per cent said they spoke to their children about this.
People want to be cared for by a family member, but they are not taking the steps to have that conversation, says Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide Life Insurance Company.
This is the way to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: you can't prepare your family to care for you if you don't express your wishes in advance.
Work with your advisor and family to discuss where and how to get care, as these options can be a determining factor in the cost.
Include your financial advisor in the conversion, as he may also be able to help you find a way to pay for these costs.
Long-term care funding options may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value to help cover costs or to insure oneself with one's own savings, as long as one has the money.
Negotiate your legal documents: get ahead of the legal battles.
Ensure that you have a medical power of attorney to designate a trusted person to oversee your medical care and ensure that professionals are fulfilling your wishes in the event that you are unable to communicate.
It can also prepare a power of attorney for its finances.
Select a trusted person to handle your financial affairs and ensure that your bills are paid if you become incapacitated.
Don &apos; t forget the small details: imagine your elderly father has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about drugs and allergies?
Describe all these details in a written plan so that it is always at hand.
Not only are finances at stake, but also what kind of doctors to treat.
What medications is he taking?
Who will take care of the dog?
You have to plan everything.
Several shots fired at a man with a rifle in Ilfracombe
He has been shot at several times with a rifle while walking home after leaving the house at night.
The victim, a man in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe (Devon) when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Police officers described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 (BST), as a "random act".
The victim did not see his attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening and the police have made an appeal for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died in the powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said. The death toll is expected to rise.
With communications blocked, the aid workers have been unable to obtain any information from the Donggala Regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicentre of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu after the disaster.
Here are some important details about Palu and Donggala, on Sulawesi Island:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala Regency is a regency that stretches along more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwestern part of Sulawesi Island.
The Regency, which is a lower-level administrative region, had an estimated population of 299,200 people in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of Central Sulawesi, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but are concentrated mainly in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire, an area of high seismic activity, and is frequently hit by earthquakes.
Following, we summarize some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of the past few years:
2004: A major earthquake in the western coast of the province of Aceh in northern Sumatra, on 26 December 2004, triggered a tsunami that affected 14 countries and claimed the lives of 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast. More than half of the victims occurred in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes struck the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of fatalities occurred on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake devastated the southern tip of Java, the most populous island in Indonesia, and triggered a tsunami that affected the southern coast, killing almost 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra Province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands, near Sumatra, triggering a tsunami of up to 10 metres that destroyed dozens of villages and killed some 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the regency of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, recalling the devastation of the 2004 killer earthquake and tsunami.
This time, no tsunami was triggered, but the collapse of buildings killed more than 100 people.
2018: Lombok Island (Indonesia) was hit by a series of large earthquakes that killed more than 500 people, most of them on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily displaced.
Sarah Palin &apos; s eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a domestic violence report and resisting arrest, according to a police report released Saturday.
According to the police report, when a known acquaintance attempted to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took the phone away from her.
Palin has been remanded to Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is being held on a $5,000 non-guaranteed bond, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he was declared "absolutely innocent" when asked to make a statement, reported the network.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, which could mean up to a year in prison and a $25,000 fine.
He has also been charged with a Class B misdemeanor, which carries a one-day jail sentence and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with a criminal offence.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Sarah Palin, the mother of the victim, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska veterans court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, interfering with a domestic violence complaint and possessing a firearm while intoxicated, in relation to the incident.
His girlfriend claimed that he punched her in the face.
Several veterans groups criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 for linking her son &apos; s violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder stemming from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds dead
At least 384 people died after a 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A 7.5 magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The power and communications networks have collapsed and it is expected that the death toll will rise in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred just to the side of the Sulawesi centre, which is located to the north-east of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
There are several videos circulating on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach party in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for a suspect in the New York terror attack
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terror attack that killed eight people, an extraordinary punishment that has not been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out a bike path attack in Manhattan's West Side Highway on October 31, 2017, mowing down pedestrians and cyclists in his path.
To justify a death sentence, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov killed "intentionally" the eight victims and caused "intentionally" serious physical injuries, in accordance with the notice of intent to seek the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
The two charges carry a possible death penalty, according to the document.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of murder in aid of racketeering, which federal prosecutors often use in these cases, and one count of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "substantial planning and premeditation", prosecutors said, describing how Saipov carried it out as "atrocious, cruel and depraved".
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damages and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco, as specified in the notice of intention.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
It has been over a decade since the last death penalty case was prosecuted in the Southern District of New York.
Khalid Barnes was found guilty of murdering two drug dealers but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last federal death penalty in New York was carried out in 1953 against Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Rosenberg was executed by electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, an Uzbek immigrant, showed no remorse in the days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack by watching ISIS videos on his phone.
The police also requested that the ISIS flag be flown in the hospital room of the injured man.
He has been found not guilty on 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said that the defense team was "obviously disappointed" with the decision of the prosecution.
We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a guilty plea with a life sentence without the possibility of parole will only prolong the trauma for all those involved in these events.
Saipov &apos; s defence team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel Farage should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilise the people's army" today during a Tory conference protest.
The former leader of UKIP said politicians had to "feel the heat" from Eurosceptics, while one of Theresa May &apos; s MPs suggested he should be in charge of Brexit negotiations.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said at the Birmingham rally that the UK would have "already left" if Nigel Farage had been Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge facing Theresa May to reconcile her divided party has been highlighted even more by a group of Tory Brexiteers joining a protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is fighting to keep the Chequers agreement on track in the face of attacks from Brexit supporters, opponents and the EU.
The allies insisted that they would continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the violent reaction, and would force Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between their package and "chaos".
Leave Means Leave MP John Bone said at the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to reject Chequers.
He suggested that Farage should have been given a role with responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
If he had been in charge, we would have been out by now," he said.
This Member of Parliament for Wellingborough added: "I am going to defend Brexit, but we have to get rid of Chequers."
In his statement of opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought in world wars to be servile."
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay in the European Union is completely false."
Andrea Jenkyns, the pro-Brexit Tory MP, was also at the protest, where she told reporters: "I just say one thing: Prime Minister, listen to the people."
The public in general does not like Chequers, the opposition will not vote for it, and it is not popular within our party and our activists, who are the ones who actually go out on the streets and vote for us first.
Forget Chequers and start listening.
In a message to May, he added: "First ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Farage told the packed room that if politicians felt the heat, they would be more likely to stick to the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
It is now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class.
They are trying to betray Brexit and today we are here to tell them that they will not get away with it.
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want to make our political class, which is about to betray Brexit, feel the heat."
We are going to mobilise the people's army of this country that gave us victory with Brexit and we will never rest until we have become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, those in favour of the stay were out on the streets of Birmingham before the two-hour rally in the city centre.
Some activists waved placards reading "Tories Against Brexit" after the group's presentation this weekend.
Labour peer Lord Adonis mocked the Tories for the security problems they had with an application during the conference opening.
These are the same people who tell us that they can implement the computer systems and all the technology for Canada Plus Plus, for the border in harmony, for the free trade zone without borders in Ireland.
It is a total farce.
There is nothing that can be called a good Brexit, he added.
Warren considers all possibilities for running for president
US Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "consider all options" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against Geoff Diehl, the Republican state representative, who was co-chairman of Trump &apos; s 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
There has been a lot of speculation about the possibility of Warren facing Trump in 2020.
His Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 30th town hall meeting since Trump took office, all using the municipal format.
A volunteer asked if he was planning to run for the presidency.
Warren responded that it was time for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that included having a woman at the top.
A man arrested for the murder of LSU football player Sims
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced Saturday that a suspect had been arrested in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at a press conference at 11 a.m.
They had already released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help in identifying a man seen in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot to death near the campus of Southern University early Friday morning.
Wayde Sims was shot in the head and ultimately died from his injuries, said Police Chief Murphy J. Paul to the media on Saturday, for 247sports.
Wayde went to defend a friend and was shot by Simpson.
During the interrogation, Simpson admitted to being at the scene of the crime, in possession of a weapon and having shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and booked into the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 1.98-metre-tall Baton Rouge native, played in 32 games last season, starting 10, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton closes in on the world title after his team handed him victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Bottas beat Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that Mercedes team orders would play a key role in the race.
From pole position, Bottas had a good start and almost put Hamilton out of the picture by defending his position in the first two laps and inviting Vettel to attack his team-mate.
Vettel was the first to go into the pits and let Hamilton run in the back of the group, something that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes came out a lap later and was behind Vettel, but Hamilton overtook after a wheel-to-wheel move that left the Ferrari driver having to give up the inside line at risk of losing out later on in the third corner.
Max Verstappen, who was 21 on that day, started from the back of the grid and finished seventh at the end of the first race.
He then led a large part of the race while hanging on to his tyres to achieve a quick finish and pass Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
Finally, he came into boxes on lap 44, but was unable to increase his pace in the remaining eight laps after Raikkonen had taken fourth place.
It has been a tough day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and was a real gentleman by letting me go.
The team has done an exceptional job to get a perfect pair,” said Hamilton.
That was really bad body language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein on Saturday for her insistence that she did not leak Christine Blasey Ford &apos; s letter accusing Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in Virginia, the President did not directly reference Mr. Ford &apos; s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that there were &quot; bad, disgusting and false people &quot; there.
The only thing that could happen and the good thing that is happening in the Senate right now is when you see anger, when you see bad people, disgusting people and liars.
When you read the publications and the leaks, and then they say "But I didn't do it."
I didn &apos; t do it.
Do you remember?
Senator Dianne Feinstein, did you leak this?
Remember your response... did you filter the document? - "Oh, oh, oh, oh!"
Oh, no.
I did not filter it."
Well, wait a minute.
Have we filtered it? No, we haven &apos; t filtered it, he said, imitating the senator.
Feinstein received the letter detailing Ford &apos; s allegations against Kavanaugh in July and the leak was reported in early September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.
I did not hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I did not leak her story," said Feinstein to the committee, as reported by The Hill.
She asked me to keep it confidential, and I did.
But the president's refusal did not sit well with him, as he said during Saturday night's rally: "I'm telling you, that was some bad body language."
Perhaps he didn &apos; t, but that &apos; s the worst body language I &apos; ve ever seen.”
Continuing with his defence of the Supreme Court nominee accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the President suggested that the Democrats were using the allegations for their own ends.
They are determined to regain power by any means possible.
You see the evil and the repugnance, they don &apos; t care who they hurt, who they have to step on to get power and control, &quot; said the president, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars bounced back from their Elite League defeat to Belfast Giants on Friday by winning the return match 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants took an early 2-0 lead thanks to the goals of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied the local match before Dwyer regained the lead for the Giants.
François Bouchard scored for Dundee before two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured their victory.
This was the third defeat in a row for the men of Adam Keefe, who had beaten Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, with the Giants having won the previous three.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute (3:35) thanks to an assist from Kendall McFaull, while David Rutherford provided the assist for Beauvillier to double the lead four minutes later.
In what was a very lively opening period, Sullivan put the local team back in the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt tied the game at 15:16 with Cownie.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took the lead before the first break when he scored his second goal of the night at the end of the first half.
The local team regrouped and Bouchard once again equalized the game with a goal in the 27:37 minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the game in the second half and secure victory with the fifth goal of their team as the game approached its conclusion.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, play at home against Milton Keynes on Friday.
A controller on the ground dies so hundreds of people can escape on the plane of the earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller is being hailed as a hero after ensuring a plane carrying hundreds of people safely took off.
More than 800 people died and many more are missing after a massive earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to rock the area, and many are trapped in the rubble in the city of Palu.
Despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at the control tower of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He insisted on ensuring that Batik Air flight 6321, which was on the runway at that time, could take off safely.
He jumped from the control tower when he thought it was about to collapse.
He later died in hospital.
The spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, reported Australian broadcaster ABC News.
We had prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"Our hearts break when we hear this," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach several thousand people. The national disaster mitigation agency says access to Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
It is believed that the number of victims will continue to rise, as many bodies are still under the rubble and many people have not been able to be contacted.
Tsunami waves up to six metres high have devastated Palu, which will hold a mass burial on Sunday.
Assistance and supplies are being brought in by military and commercial aircraft.
35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma told Sky News: "Every minute, an ambulance arrives with more bodies."
Clean water is scarce.
The mini-markets are being looted everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is trying to help as much as possible, but we don't know what they will find there."
That is a tragedy in itself, but it could have been much worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country &apos; s military: &quot; I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
CNN reported that the team was ready.
Indonesia had already been hit by earthquakes in Lombok in the first half of this year, killing more than 550 people.
Air Niugini now says a man is missing after the Micronesia air disaster
The airline, which operated the plane that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now says one man is missing, after saying earlier that all 47 passengers and crew had escaped safely from the plane as it sank.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday evening, it had been unable to account for a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats were used to help rescue the other passengers and crew after the aircraft crashed into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk International Airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been transferred to a hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday and all were in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events are still unclear.
The airline and the United States Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon before the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had overshot the runway.
Bill Jaynes, a United States passenger, said the plane came in very low.
That is extremely good, said Jaynes.
Jaynes comments that he and other passengers were able to wade through water that reached their waists to the emergency exits of the plane that was beginning to sink.
He said that the flight attendants panicked and screamed, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The US Navy said that sailors working on a nearby pier also helped in the rescue by using an inflatable boat to ferry people to shore before the plane sank about 30 metres (100 feet) below the water.
Data from the PNG Air Safety Network shows that 111 people have died in registered airline accidents in PNG over the past two decades, but none with Air Niugini.
A timeline of the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecution wrapped up its arguments in the new trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014 on Saturday.
Paul Rowlett, an expert witness from the Department of Justice of the United States, testified for hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used the records from Quinton Tellis &apos; s mobile phone to link Tellis &apos; s movements to the night Jessica Chambers died.
Rowlett said he received data from several mobile phones that showed Chambers was with Tellis the night of his death, contradicting earlier statements by Tellis, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that Chambers &apos; s mobile phone had been with Sanford &apos; s phone during the time Chambers said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford took the stand on Saturday and testified that he had not been in the city on that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford &apos; s truck that night, Sanford said he was &quot; lying, because my truck was in Nashville &quot;.
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he had met Chambers approximately two weeks before his death.
Mobile phone records showed that the incident was only known about a week before.
Rowlett said that at some point after Chambers &apos; s death, Tellis deleted messages, calls and contact information for Chambers from his phone.
Hale said, "She was erased from his life."
The defence is scheduled to begin its final submissions on Sunday.
The judge said he hoped the trial would be completed that day by the jury.
The High Breed: What is Conscious Hip Hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to fill their music with positive messages to challenge the negative image of the genre.
The High Breed, from Bristol, says that hip hop has moved away from its roots of political messages and social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Acts such as The Fugees and Common have seen a recent resurgence in the UK thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
A New York nanny sues couple for text message "racist"
A New York nanny is suing a couple for discrimination after receiving an incorrect text message from the mother complaining that she was "another black person".
The couple denies that it is racist and compares the claim with a case of "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her shock at discovering that the new child care worker, Giselle Maurice, was black on her first day of work in 2016.
Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband, "NO MORE BLACK PEOPLE," in a text message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Maurice twice.
After realizing his mistake, a "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman fired Maurice, claiming that his previous nanny, who was African-American, had done a poor job and that he was expecting a Filipino nanny, according to the New York Post.
Maurice received a day's pay and sent it home on Uber.
Maurice is now suing the couple for wrongful termination with the intention of receiving $350 per day for the six-month position for which he had been hired, but without a contract.
He said, "I want to show you that things don't happen that way," and added, "I know this is a case of discrimination."
The couple responded to the allegations that they were racist by saying that the termination of Maurice &apos; s employment was the most reasonable, as they feared that they could not trust him after having offended him.
My wife had sent him something he didn &apos; t want to say.
She is not racist.
Joel Plasco, the husband of the victim, told the Post, "We are not racists."
But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you had been rude to, even if it was an accident?
Your newborn?
Come on!
Comparing the demand as "extortion", Plasco said his wife had given birth to the baby two months earlier and was in a "very difficult situation".
Are you going to go after someone like that?
That is not a very decent thing to do,” said the investment banker.
Although the legal case is still pending, the couple has been denounced on social media, criticised for their behaviour and logic.
Paddington editors feared that readers would not identify with a talking bear, revealed in a new letter
Karen Jankel, Bond &apos; s daughter, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: &quot; It was hard to put yourself in the place of someone reading it for the first time before publication.
It is very funny to know now what we know about the great success of Paddington Bear.
After saying that his father, who had worked as a BBC camera operator before being inspired by a teddy bear to write a children's book, had hoped his work would be rejected, he added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was "a bit bittersweet" after his death last year.
She described Paddington as "a very important member of our family" and added that her father was very proud of her final success.
He was a very calm man who did not like to boast.
But as Paddington had been so real to him, it was almost as if he had a son who had achieved something important: you were proud of him, even though it wasn't really your achievement.
I think he saw Paddington's success in that way.
Although he created and owned Paddington, he always gave credit to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye by phone
When they landed, their daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where the doctors worked in vain to save her life.
She called regularly to say that the situation was really bad, that she did not expect to succeed.
I then received a call from Nad to tell me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And so I did.
I said: "Tashi, I love you very much."
I will be with you soon.
I will be with you.
The drugs the doctors had given him to keep his heart pumping were wearing off slowly and leaving his system.
She had died too soon and everything was going dark.
I could only sit there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn't scream, cry or yell because I was in a situation surrounded by families and people.
I really had to stick to my guns.
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now suffering the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, unaware of the terrible experience that was unfolding.
No one knew.
I bent my head and the tears were falling all the time.
It is hard to explain, but it was on the flight where I felt this overwhelming sense of sympathy for Nad.
That I needed all my love and understanding.
He knew how much he loved her.
Women in mourning put up suicide prevention cards to bridge the gap
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide are working to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been putting cards on a Welsh bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers to call for help.
Tyler, the son of Mrs. Davis, began to suffer from depression at the age of 13 and committed suicide at the age of 18.
I don't want any father to feel what I feel every day.
Davis, 45, of Lydney, said his son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that her smile lit up any place.
However, he left his job before he died, as he was "in a really dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother found him after he had taken his own life.
Ms. Davis said: "I am constantly worried about the consequences."
Davis created the cards "so that people know that there are people to go to and people to talk to, even if it is a friend."
Don't keep quiet, you have to talk about it.
Ms. Humphreys, who has been Davies' friend for years, lost her partner Mark, with whom she had been together for 15 years, shortly after the death of her mother.
He did not say he was depressed or anything like that.
Two days before Christmas we noticed a change in his attitude.
Christmas Day reached its lowest point: when the children opened their presents, he did not even look at them.
He said that his death was a great trauma for them, but they had to get over it: "It leaves a big hole in the family."
It has left us devastated.
But we all have to keep fighting.

Brett Kavanaugh &apos; s future hangs in the balance as the FBI begins its investigation
I thought if we could actually get something like what he was asking for (a limited time, a limited scope investigation), maybe we could bring a little unity to the committee, and I feared that the committee was going to go off the rails in the middle of a partisan stalemate.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican backers not want the FBI investigation?
Their refusal is entirely due to the timing.
There are only five weeks left until the midterm elections on November 6. If, as expected, the Republicans have a bad showing, their efforts to elect the man they want for the highest court in the land will be seriously weakened.
George W. Bush has been calling senators, pressuring them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for him in the White House. Thanks to Bush, Kavanaugh met his wife Ashley, who was the personal secretary to the President.
What happens once the FBI releases its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie and confirm him for the Supreme Court.
The numbers of North Korean deserters "fall" in line with Kim
The number of defectors from North Korea to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Ministry of Reunification of the South, said that there were 1,127 desertions last year, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Park said that the tighter border controls between North Korea and China, and the high fees charged by traffickers, had been the key factors.
Pyongyang has not commented publicly on the matter.
Most of the deserters from the north eventually receive South Korean citizenship.
Seúl says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most escape through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers deserters to be illegal immigrants rather than refugees, and they are often repatriated.
Relations between the North and the South, which are technically still at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss negotiations on denuclearization.
This followed the historic Singapore summit between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in June, where they agreed in general terms to work towards a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the lack of progress on U.S. sanctions.
Without the trust of the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and under these circumstances, we will not be the first to disarm unilaterally, Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is not fit to serve on the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the minority in the House of Representatives, said that Brett Kavanaugh, the nominee to the Supreme Court, was a "histrionic" and was not fit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
Pelosi said she could not stop thinking that if a woman had acted in that way, she would have been called a hysteric.
Kavanaugh used emotion to deny the sexual assault allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost shouting and choking as he spoke of his family and his years of secondary education.
He also condemned explicitly the Democrats, calling the allegations against him "grotesque and clearly coordinated smears" organized by angry liberals who were upset that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that, in her opinion, Kavanaugh &apos; s testimony proved that he could not serve on the Supreme Court because it showed his bias against Democrats.
I think he has disqualified himself with those statements and the way he has pursued the Clintons and the Democrats.
Pelosi objected when asked if she would oppose Kavanaugh if he were confirmed and the Democrats had a majority in the House.
Pelosi said, "I will say one thing: If he is not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, he will not be fit to be on the Supreme Court, and he will not be fit to be on the court he is on now."
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about possible rulings by Kavanaugh against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case, which is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
Pelosi said, "This is not the time for a hysterical person and an impartial person to go to court and expect us to think that everything is all right."
And women have to pick it up.
It is a justified rant, it has been months and years of fury spilling over, and she cannot let it go without crying.
"We cry when we are angry," said Ms. Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think that's all that unusual, do you?"
She continued: "I was helped a lot by a woman who was an executive in some company, and she told me that she also cried when she was angry, but that she had developed a technique whereby when she was angry and began to cry, she would say to the person she was talking to: "Perhaps you think I am crying because I am sad."
No, I am not angry.
And he continued with what he was doing.
I thought it was great.
Crying is allowed as a way out of anger because, in part, it is not well understood.
One of the clearest memories I have of one of my first jobs, in a male-dominated office, was when I found myself crying with an unexpressed rage. A serious older woman, a manager I had always been a little afraid of, grabbed me by the neck and dragged me up a flight of stairs.
He said, "Never let them see you cry."
They have no idea you are furious.
They think you are sad and will be happy because they think they have cornered you.
Patricia Schroeder, a former Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Hart was caught in an extramarital affair aboard the Monkey Business, she had to withdraw from the presidential race, and Schroeder, deeply frustrated, came up with the idea that there was no reason why she could not run for president herself.
"It was not a well-considered decision," he said to me with a laugh 30 years later.
There were already seven candidates in the race and they didn't need another one.
Someone called us "Snow White and the Seven Dwarves".
As the campaign was already well underway, it fell behind in fundraising, so it was promised that it would not enter the race again unless it raised $2 million.
It was a lost cause.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men, gave her only $250.
"Do you think I get a discount?"
When she announced that she would not have a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotion (gratitude for the people who had supported her, frustration with a system that made fundraising difficult and focused on capturing votes rather than delegates, and anger at sexism), that she choked.
It would have been logical to think that he had had a nervous breakdown, recalled Schroeder, remembering the media reaction.
You might have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, "What are they going to put on my tombstone?"
Did you "cry?"
China may benefit from the trade war between the United States and China
The first salvos of the trade war between the United States and China were deafening, and although the battle is far from over, a rupture between the countries could benefit Beijing, experts say.
US President Donald Trump issued the first warning in early 2018 by imposing tariffs on the main Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation occurred this week with new tariffs that will affect $200 billion (£150 billion) in goods, which will raise taxes on half of the goods that enter the United States from China.
In all cases, Beijing has responded in kind, recently imposing tariffs of 5 to 10 per cent on US$60 billion worth of goods.
China has pledged to retaliate in kind against any U.S. attacks, and it is unlikely that the world's second-largest economy will back down soon.
To back down would be to concede to Washington, but to publicly submit to the United States would be too shameful for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Even so, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards right, the trade war with the United States could help China in the long run by reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could set the stage for a sudden economic collapse in either country is actually much more dangerous than the audience has recognized so far, said Abigail Grace, a research associate at the Center for New American Security focused on Asia.
Syria is ready to welcome back refugees, says the Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready to welcome back refugees and calls for help to rebuild a country devastated by a war that has been going on for more than seven years.
In a speech before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the country's conditions were improving.
The situation on the ground is today more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism.
The government is still trying to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists in an attempt to restore normality.
All conditions are in place for the voluntary return of refugees who had to leave their country because of terrorism and unilateral economic sanctions that affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
There are still six million people in the country who need humanitarian assistance.
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding the country.
But he also emphasized that he would not accept conditional help or help from countries that had supported the insurgency.
Ryder Cup goes to Europe in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the American team 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National, outside Paris (France).
The United States has now suffered six consecutive defeats on European soil since its last victory in the Ryder Cup in Europe in 1993.
Europe reclaimed the crown when the Thomas Bjorn-led Danish team managed to win 14.5 points to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had to fight most of the way through the tournament, threw in his towel on the 16th hole, a par 3, admitting defeat to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Francesco Molinari was in top form throughout the tournament, becoming one of only four players to have ever achieved a 5-0-0 score since the current format began in 1979.
Jordan Spieth of the United States lost 5 and 4 to the lowest-ranked player on the European team, Denmark's Thorbjorn Olesen.
World number one Dustin Johnson lost 2 and 1 to Englishman Ian Poulter, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
Spanish Sergio García, a veteran who has already won eight Ryder Cups, became the European player with the most points in the history of the tournament with 25.5 points in his career.
I don &apos; t usually cry, but I can &apos; t help it today.
It has been a very tough year.
I am deeply grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I am very, very happy to have been able to recover the cup.
It was a team effort and I am very proud to have been able to help,” said an emotional García after the European team's victory.
Now it is the turn of his compatriot John Rahm, who beat the legendary American golfer Tiger Woods by 2 and 1 in a singles match on Sunday.
I feel an incredible sense of pride in having beaten Tiger Woods, because I have grown up watching this man play golf," said 23-year-old golfer John Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a 13-21-3 record in his Ryder Cup career.
That is an odd statistic for one of the all-time greats, who has won 14 major titles, trailing only Jack Nicklaus.
The American team had to fight all weekend to find the streets, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played great golf all week.
Captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team's disappointing performance: "I am very proud of these guys, they never stopped fighting."
There was a moment this morning when we heated up the situation in Europe.
But we ruin it.
I want to congratulate Thomas.
He is a great captain.
His 12 players have played a very good game.
We will regroup, I will meet with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we will move forward.
I love these 12 boys and I am proud to be their captain.
Now it is our turn to bow our heads.
They have outdone us.”
Red tide update: Red tide concentrations in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota counties are decreasing
The new report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission (Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission) shows a general decrease in red tide concentrations in the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, irregular flowering conditions are being reported in areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties, suggesting a reduction in concentrations.
The red tide bloom extends approximately 130 miles along the Pinellas County coast from the north to the south end of Lee County.
