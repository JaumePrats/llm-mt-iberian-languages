The goal of USA Gymnastics and USOC is the same: to make gymnastics and other sports as safe as possible so that athletes can pursue their dreams in a protected, positive, and enhanced environment.

In addition to confirming that at least some dinosaurs were plumíferos, a theory that is already generally accepted, it also offers specific data that fossils generally do not offer, such as their color and three-dimensional structure.
According to the experts, this bird has a reddish-brown plumage on the upper part of its body and a pale or caroteneous color on the lower part.
In addition, the discovery allows us to better understand the evolution of the feathers of birds.
Given that the feathers of dinosaurs do not have a well-developed axis, called the raquis, but do have other feather characteristics (quills and barbules), the researchers came to the conclusion that it is likely that the raquis is the result of a later evolutionary development of these other characteristics.
The structure of the plumage suggests that its function was not related to flight, but rather to regulate temperature or as an indicator of the same. The researchers argue that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample analyzed presents features of the plumage of an adult and not of a hatchling.
The opinions of the experts were that, even though it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample illustrates more the plumage of an adult than that of a chick.

Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, who currently holds the position of senator and is the first lady of the Argentine Republic, announced last night in La Plata, a city located 50 kilometers (31 miles) from Buenos Aires, that she will run for president.
The Teatro Argentino was the place where Mrs. Kirchner announced her intention to run for president; this is the same place where she began her campaign for the Senate in 2005, representing the province of Buenos Aires.
The question that gave rise to the debate was the controversy surrounding the budget earmarked for relief and reconstruction after Hurricane Katrina, which some conservative fiscal hawks tagged around in jest as the "New Orleans Agreement of Bush."

Although it was an essentially theoretical work, the program was written with the purpose of simulating the observations made to the galaxy of Sagittarius.
It would be the forces of gravity between the dark matter present in the galaxy and that of the Milky Way that would cause the effect expected by the group of scientists.
The Milky Way influences the galaxy of Sagittarius in the same way that the moon exerts a force of attraction on our planet and causes the tides.
The experts came to the conclusion that the dark matter interacts with itself in the same way that regular matter does.
This theory states that the majority of the dark matter that surrounds a galaxy is located around it in a class of halo and is composed of numerous small particles.

The extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) was detected for the first time by Dr. Tony Moll in South Africa's Zululandia.
During an interview, he noted that the new variant generates "a lot of concern and alarm, given its high mortality rate."
Dr. Moll believes that some patients may have contracted the virus inside the hospital, and at least two of the infected workers were health care workers at that hospital.
In a year, an infected person can spread the disease to between 10 and 15 people with whom he or she has had close contact.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the total number of TB patients in South Africa still seems to be low: 6000 of a total of 333 000 patients infected at a particular moment in South Africa.

In France, elections have traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters are isolated in a cubicle and fill out a pre-printed ballot that indicates the candidate they have chosen.
After the officials confirm the identity of the voter, he or she enters the ballot into the ballot box and signs the list of voters.
The French electoral law establishes the procedures quite strictly.

The candidates have the right to send representatives to monitor each stage of the process and, during the night, the volunteers count the votes under a rigorous supervision and in accordance with specific procedures.

Although there are reports that indicate that the official death toll is eight and the authorities have confirmed that about 30 people were injured, the official death toll is still unknown.
Concentrations of cyanuric acid and melamine were found in the urine samples of animals that died after ingesting food for pets contaminated.
The researchers indicated that the two compounds react with each other to give rise to crystals that can obstruct the renal function.
Specialists detected the formation of crystals in the urine of cats, due to the incorporation of melamine and cianuric acid.
When compared through the use of infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), it could be determined that the composition of the crystals is the same as that found in the urine of the affected animals.
I don't know if you're aware of this or not, but most of the products coming from Central America to this country are tax-free.
Even so, the countries of Central America imposed tariffs of eighty percent on the products that we manufacture. We treat you like that.
It seemed to me that that didn't make sense; definitely not fair.
The only thing I tell people is that you treat us the way we treat you.
A bill was proposed by the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, that would make it illegal to sell or rent violent video games to minors.
The bill proposes that violent video games sold in the state of California must be labeled with a sticker with the legend "18" and penalizes their sale to minors with a fine of $1000.
The Director of the Crown Prosecution Service, Kier Starmer QC, made a statement this morning informing that Huhne and Pryce will be brought to trial.

Carpanedo participated in two individual races in addition to Wednesday's competition.
The first was the slalom, in which he got a "Did not finish the first race", as well as 36 of the 116 participants in that race.
In his other race, the giant slalom, he got the tenth place in the women's group with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes behind the first Austrian finalist, Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes behind the ninth finalist, Gyöngyi Dani, from Hungary.
Four skiers in the slalom category did not complete their races and a total of 45 participants in the Giant Slalom did not reach the classification in the race.
The police force of Madhya Pradesh was able to recover the laptop and the mobile phone that had been stolen.
The inspector general adjunto, D.K. Arya, declared: "We have arrested five individuals who abused the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop computer."

Then he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been on trial in the Court of the County of Edinburgh, accused of the murder of her son.
While she is under custody awaiting trial, any testimony of an eyewitness can be questioned, as her image has been widely disseminated.
It is a common practice in other parts of the United Kingdom, but as the Scottish justice system works differently, the courts considered the publication of photographs to be potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee said: "It seems that journalists are walking on thin ice when they publish photos or other information about the suspects."
The Office of the Crown, which is in charge of the processing, indicated to the journalists that they would not make any additional comments at least until the auto of the process is dictated.
According to the information that has been leaked, the document will deal with the border conflict, which Palestine intends to resolve based on the pre-1967 borders.
Other topics that were also discussed included the future state of Jerusalem, which both nations consider sacred, and the problem of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after the agreement is signed, while PA only agrees to five.
During the complementary pest control trial, the game wardens had to supervise the shooters closely, given that they were being monitored and evaluated for their effectiveness.
In a partnership between NPWS and the New South Wales branch of the National Shooting Sports Association (NSW) Inc., volunteers were recruited from within the Association's shooting program.
Mick O'Flynn, who is in charge, provisionally, of the office of Conservation and Heritage of the NPWS, pointed out that a comprehensive training and safety course was given to the four shooters selected for the operation.
Yesterday, President Martelly swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP, for its English acronym) of nine members.
In four years, it will be the fifth CEP of Martelly.
Last month, a presidential commission advised the CEP to resign, in the context of a series of measures that aim to lead the country towards new elections.
The commission was the way in which Martelly responded to the generalized demonstrations that began in October against the regime.
The demonstrations, at times violent, were caused by the fact that elections are not being carried out, in some cases since 2011.
More than 60 cases of iPods with problems of malfunctioning and overheating have been reported, which have caused six fires and minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) reported that it had registered 27 accidents involving these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 additional incidents of overheating, which the company classified as "non-serious."
The ministry pronounced itself in relation to the delay in the report of Apple, saying that it was something "truly lamentable."
Mariana was shaken by a quake at 7:19 p.m. local time (21:19 GMT) on Friday.

Later, the photographers took over the place of an old woman because she needed to go to the bathroom. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began to study medicine.
She received training in obstetrics and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
Liggins began his research on preterm birth in his spare time, while working in the hospital.
His study showed that fetal lung maturation could be accelerated through the administration of a hormone.
Xinhua reported that on Wednesday the investigators for the government were able to recover the flight recorders from the black box.
The wrestlers who fought alongside the moon also paid their respects.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first queen of the Extreme. She died on the night of the two moons, something unique, like her. A strong woman."
Dustin Oro in Dusty Runnels declared: "Luna was as rare as I am; even more so. I love her and I miss her. I hope she's in a better place."
From 2008, of the 1400 people surveyed in advance of the federal elections of 2010, there was an increase of 8 % of those opposed to Australia becoming a republic.
Julia Gillard, interim prime minister, stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she considered Australia should become a republic once the reign of Queen Elizabeth II had ended.
34% of the respondents share this view and want Queen Isabel II to be the last Queen of Australia.
In one end of the survey, 29 % of people think that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible; in the other end, 31 % think that it should never become a republic.
The winner of the Olympic gold medal in the 100-meter freestyle and 200-meter freestyle had to swim in the freestyle style and three relays in the Commonwealth Games, but his physical condition has been put in doubt after his complaints.
He hasn't been able to take any painkillers to relieve the pain, because it's forbidden to use them in the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
Many people verified the discovery through the use of various types of hardware and software, and at the beginning of February, it was announced on Tuesday.
It is possible that comets have served as a source of water for our planet, as well as organic matter, which has the capacity to form proteins and sustain life.
The expectation of the scientists is to understand how planets are formed, in particular our own, given that comets have crashed into the Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, who is 53 years old, took office at the beginning of the year and last month signed a law that allows people of the same sex to get married.
He dismissed the rumors as "political gossip and nonsense."
It is speculated that he will run for president in the 2016 elections.
NextGen is a system that, according to the Federal Aviation Administration, would reduce the distances of air routes, which would save millions of gallons of fuel per year, as well as carbon emissions.
Uses satellite technology, in contrast to the old technology of ground-based radar, with the aim of enabling air traffic controllers to detect aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate data.
There will be no additional transport and the trains will not stop at Wembley. There will be no parking for cars and the deterrent will not be available.
Due to the concern generated by the possible lack of transportation, it was considered the possibility that the game would be played closed doors, without the fanatics of the team.
On Thursday, Science magazine published an article about the discovery of a new species of bird in the Galápagos Islands.
Experts from the University of Princeton, in the U.S., and from the University of Uppsala, in Sweden, announced that the new species was able to evolve in just two generations, even though it was estimated that it would take much longer, because of the reproduction between a Darwin's finch endemic, Geospiza fortis, and a cactus-finch migratory, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can take on all kinds of forms and can be wound into tiny figures.
Not only can it be hammered and rolled into sheets, but it is also possible to stretch it until it becomes a very fine wire that can be twisted and braided.
It can be made very thin and adhere to another metal. It is so thin that it could be used to decorate the illustrations made by hand in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical substance. You can make a pH indicator using red cabbage juice.
The color of the cabbage juice will be altered depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical substance is.
The number of ions of hydrogen (the H in pH) present in the chemical product determines its level of pH.
The atoms of hydrogen are formed by a proton and an electron. Therefore, an ion of hydrogen is the result of depriving a proton of its electron.
Shake both dry powders together and, after doing so, with clean and moistened hands, knead them to form a ball.
There will be a reaction between the moisture in their hands and their external layers, which will feel strange to the touch and will form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had in-house toilets with drainage in almost all the houses, which were connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
In some homes of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece, traces of sewer systems were found.
They also had bathrooms in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In the Roman civilization, public baths had toilets and some were shared by men and women.
When one communicates with someone who is thousands of miles away, one is making use of a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and, then, reflects it back almost instantly.
The satellite was sent to space through a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space, because the light of the atmosphere of the Earth distorts part of the light and the view that we have.
You need a giant rocket, more than 100 feet tall, to be able to carry a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in surprising ways. The most important thing it has done for us is to give us a much simpler and faster way to travel.
Thanks to her, today we have many means of transport, such as the railway or the car, among many others.
Below, there are medium-sized carnivores that feed on medium-sized prey, such as rabbits, deer, and antelope.
Finally, there are many small felids (which include domestic cats) that feed on species of small size that exist in much greater numbers, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of its success is the concept of niche: each cat has a particular function, which prevents it from competing with other cats.
Lions are the big cats that socialize the most, and their lives take place in large groups called prides.
The herds are formed by one to three adult males of the same family group, united with up to thirty females and their calves.
Usually, the females are very close to each other, which makes them a great family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides have the same behavior as packs of wolves or dogs, with which they share a surprising similarity (unlike the other great cats) both in their behavior and in that they are highly lethal to their prey.
Integral athlete, the tiger has the ability to climb (but not very well), swim, jump (but not too well), and pull five times stronger than a strong person.
The tiger is of the same genus (Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These are the only four big cats capable of roaring.
The roar of the tiger is not a fully-sonorous roar like that of the lion, but rather, like a sentence spoken in growls and yells.
Ocelots enjoy eating small creatures. If possible, they will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all of their prey will be much smaller than they are.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find prey (prey) by using their sense of smell, smelling the ground where they have passed.
They have very good night vision and in dark places and, in addition, they move very stealthily. Ocelots hunt their prey by mimicking their surroundings and then pounce on them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) moves away from the main one (for example, if they move to a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island so that they can't go back easily), they will often find themselves in a different environment than they were used to.
The new environment has different resources and competitors, and, therefore, a new population will need different characteristics or adaptations than before to be a strong competitor.
There have been no changes in the original population, which still need the same adaptations that they had in the past.
As time passes, as the growing population begins to adapt to the new environment, it begins to look more and more like the other population.
Finally, after millions or even billions of years, the two populations will be so different that it will no longer be possible to classify them as belonging to the same species.
This process receives the name of speciation, which simply means the development of new species, and is an inevitable and fundamental consequence of evolution.
Plants generate the oxygen that people breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that they exhale (which they exhale).
The food of plants is generated with solar energy, thanks to photosynthesis. In addition, they offer us shade.
We build our houses out of plants and with them we also make clothes. Most of the food we eat are plants. Without them, animals would not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the alpha predator of its time, so it had nothing to fear, except other members of its own species.
Its long jaws were studded with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, as well as another group of teeth in the palate, which means that anything that got in its way, didn't stand a chance.
We don't have the certainty, but it could have had the viperine. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurids, and it could have been a cannibal.
He also attacked any creature that entered the water: not even a T. Rex as big as the T. Rex was a threat to him.
Although most of that food would be familiar to us, the Romans also ate some unusual items at their banquets, such as wild boar, pheasants, snails, and even a type of rodent, the dormouse.
Another thing that distinguished the rich from the poor was that the poor ate sitting down, while the rich reclined and enjoyed banquets.
It is not possible that the recipes of the ancient Rome include foods that arrived to Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
Verbigracia, they didn't have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or chocolate, and no Roman of antiquity ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a temple for each of their gods, which they considered to be their home.
The people brought sacrifices to the gods and the priests tried to satisfy the needs of those celebrating ceremonies and festivals.
The temples have an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary that only the priests could enter.
In some cases, special towers were built with a pyramid shape, called ziggurats, to be part of the temples.
The upper part of the tower was a special sanctuary for his deity.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house wasn't of much importance.
The Jewish families spent most of their time outdoors.
The women cooked in the patio; the shops were only showcases that gave onto the street. The houses were built with stone.
In the land of Canaan, there were no large forests; therefore, wood was very expensive.
Very few people lived in Greenland. According to the sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, during a voyage that took him more westward, discovered the island and gave it its name.
Even so, without detracting from his discovery, the Eskimos already inhabited the area at that time.
While each Scandinavian country was "Scandinavian", there were marked differences in relation to the people, the monarchs, the habits and the history between Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie Treasure of the Sierra Madre, you may believe that a map of the treasure was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. While the back of the document does contain something written, it is not a map of a treasure.
The Declaration of Independence has written on its reverse the phrase "Declaration of Independence original of July 4, 1776". The text appears on the lower part of the document, upside down.
Although it is not known for certain who wrote it, it is known that the huge document (it measures 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up to be stored.
Therefore, it is likely that the annotation was added only as a label.
Although the landings carried out on D-Day, as well as the subsequent confrontations, had succeeded in liberating the north of France, the south still remained.
His government was in the hands of the Vichy French, who were a group that, in 1940, had agreed to peace with the Germans and were working with the invaders instead of fighting against them.
On the 15th of August 1940, Operation Dragoon was launched, through which the Allies invaded the south of France.
In less than two weeks, American and French forces had liberated the south of France and were on their way to Germany.
A civilization can be defined as a specific culture of a large group of people who live and work together; in other words, a society.
The term civilization derives from the Latin civilis, which means civil, and is related to the word civis, of the same language, which means citizen, as well as civitas, which means city or city state, and that, in addition, determines in some way the size of the society.
States are the precursors of nations. A culture of civilization has a long-term transmission of knowledge, a durable cultural legacy, and a homogenous propagation.
Minority cultures tend to disappear without leaving any relevant historical traces, and they are not recognized as proper civilizations.
During the War of the Revolution, the thirteen states formed, in the beginning, a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation, in which the Congress was its only component.
The Congress did not have the power to levy taxes and, given that it had a national executive or judicial power, this function fell to the authorities of the states, which often did not cooperate in order to enforce all of its laws.
He wasn't able to annul tax laws or tariffs between states.
The articles demanded the unanimous approval of all the states to proceed to their amendment, and the states gave so little importance to the central government that their representatives often absented themselves.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second team with the most victories in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among the sports that are most practiced are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, figure skating and Formula 1.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern regions of the country, with athletes who participate in international tournaments and Olympic games.
In Japan, there are about 7000 islands (the largest is Honshu), which makes it the seventh largest archipelago in the world.
Due to the conglomerate/group of islands that it contains, Japan is usually referred to as an "archipelago", from a geographical point of view.
The history of Taiwan goes back to the 15th century, when European mariners who were sailing in the area registered the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, which means Beautiful Island.
The establishment, in 1624, by the Dutch East India Company, of a base in the southwest of Taiwan, marked the beginning of a transformation in the aboriginal method of grain production, with the employment of Chinese labor to work in their rice and sugar plantations.
The army of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the northern and western coastal regions of Taiwan in 1683 and declared this last one as a dependent province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after having been defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, through which it ceded the sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which retained control over the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three main buildings: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings have been reconstructed at the ends of the complex so that tourists can see what they looked like originally.
By 1976, about thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the work continues to this day.
To illustrate, the most common format for fixed-image photography at the global level is 35 mm, which was the size of film most commonly used toward the end of the era of film photography.
Today it is still happening, but the most important thing is that their dimensional relationship has been transferred to the formats of digital camera sensors.
In truth, the 35 mm format is a bit confusing, as its measurements are 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
For this reason, it is said that the dimensional ratio of this format (dividing by twelve in order to calculate the simplest rational number) equals 3:2.
Many typical formats (e.g., the APS group of formats) are similar or are very similar to this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, which has been the object of constant ridicule and many times has been mocked, is a simple pattern that generates dynamism while at the same time allowing for a certain order to be given to the images.
Indicates that the most effective position where to place the central object is the intersection formed by the horizontal and vertical lines that divide the image into thirds (see example).
During this phase of the history of Europe, the Catholic Church, which had accumulated wealth and power, was questioned.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity had succeeded in uniting the states of Europe despite their different languages and customs.
His power, present everywhere, affected everyone, from the monarch to the commoner.
One of the most important principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the funds of the church should be used for that specific purpose.
The central dome of the church had remained in Rome for more than a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money made many people wonder if this principle was being respected.
Not long after the outbreak of hostilities, the British began a naval blockade of Germany.
Although the strategy, which involved the interruption of military and civilian vital supplies, was successful, such a measure violated the generally recognized international legal principle and was contained in several international agreements of the last two centuries.
Great Britain extracted international waters in complete sectors of the ocean to block the entry of ships, even risking the safety of neutral ships.
Having received a reduced response against this tactic, Germany thought that it would find a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the attitude adopted by the majority of citizens and nations was that of pacifism and isolation.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities that occurred during the First World War, the countries wanted to prevent such a situation from happening in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the U.S. with 4 cents, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation written by Charles Batchelor (his manager in his last job) and addressed to Thomas Edison.
The ancient China had a unique way of delimiting the different periods of time. Each stage or each family in power constituted a different dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there was also a period of instability, with provinces divided. The most well-known was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years, between the Han and the Jin dynasties.
During these phases, a cruel war broke out between many nobles who were fighting for the throne.
One of the bloodiest periods in the history of Ancient China was that of the Three Kingdoms, where thousands of people died in a struggle for the throne of the great palace in Xi'an.
There are many of its political and social consequences, such as the use of the metric system, the displacement of absolutism towards republicanism, nationalism and the conviction that the country belongs to the people, and not to a single sovereign.
Likewise, after the Revolution, the posts were open to all male candidates, which allowed for the success of the most ambitious and prestigious.
The same thing happens with the military, because, instead of basing the charges of the army on class, now they are based on the caliber.
The French Revolution was also a source of inspiration for many other oppressed people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Mohammed was deeply interested in matters beyond this earthly life. He often visited a cave that became known as "Hira" in the mountain of "Noor" (light) to reflect.
The cave itself, which has endured in time, illustrates very realistically the spiritual inclinations of Mohammed.
In the summit of one of the mountains north of La Meca, lies a cave totally isolated from the rest of the planet.
In fact, it's very difficult to find, even if one were sure of its existence. Inside the cave, isolation is total.
Nothing can be seen more than the wonderful clear sky and the many mountains in the vicinity. From the interior of this cave, one can see or hear very little of this world.
Of the seven wonders, the only one that still stands is the Great Pyramid of Guiza.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptian people in the 3rd century B.C., is one of the many pyramidal structures built to venerate the deceased pharaoh.
The Necropolis of Guiza, or "Valley of the Dead", in the Valley of the Kings, in Egypt, contains numerous pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, temples, and the great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built in honor of the pharaoh Khufu, and many others of this type, tombs and smaller temples were built in honor of his wives and relatives.
The mark of "upward arc" is similar to a "V" and the mark of "downward arc" is similar to a grapheme or a square without its lower border.
Above means to start at the tip, and push the bow, and below means to start at the frog, where the hand holds the bow, and pull the bow.
The ascending arc produces a softer sound, while the descending arc is louder and more forceful.
Feel free to make your own marks with pencil, but don't forget that the marks on archery instruments have been printed in that place for a musical purpose and, therefore, should be respected.
On October 6, 1789, a crowd of women from the market forced the terrified King Louis XVI, his wife Marie Antoinette, their two small children (Maria Teresa, 11 years old, and Luis Carlos, 4 years old), and his sister, Madam Elizabeth, to return to Paris from Versailles.
They returned to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd that shouted and threw threats at the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriage all the way.
At some point, a participant in the revolution shook the head of a executed guard in Versailles in front of the queen, who was in panic.
The Filipino people themselves paid the war expenses of the imperialism of E.E. U.U. in the conquest of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial government of the U.S. with the purpose of paying the majority of the expenses and interests of the bonds that fluctuated in the name of the Filipino government in the banks of Wall Street.
From the very beginning, the super profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would be the main source of profits for American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context that gave rise to the establishment of the order.
The historical period in Europe in which these events take place is known as the Middle Ages, between the years 1000 and 1300.
The Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which, by convention, ends around 1500.
The determinism of technology is a concept that comprehends, pragmatically, a wide range of ideas, from the technological impulse or imperative to a strict sense of that there is a logic underlying the destiny of humanity and that is related to the laws of science and how they are reflected in technology.
Almost all interpretations of technological determinism have in common two general ideas: that technological development unfolds on a path independent of any cultural or political influence and that, at the same time, technology has “effects” on societies that are inherent and not socially conditioned.
To give an example, one could argue that the existence of automobiles necessarily implies the development of roads.
However, a national network of highways is not economically viable for a small number of cars, so new techniques are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The widespread use of automobiles also generates a greater incidence of traffic accidents, which leads to the development of new techniques in the field of health to repair the damaged bodies.
The element of cultural determinism was very present in romanticism, according to scholars like Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography molded people and, with the passage of time, developed customs and cultures related to that geography that, since they were in harmony with the location of that society, were preferable to laws that were imposed arbitrarily.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the world today, Constantinople was known as such in the feudal Europe.
His fame as the epicenter of luxury began approximately 400 B.C. and extended until approximately 1100 B.C.
During the twelfth century its status decayed, especially due to the fact that, upon his return, the Crusaders brought back gifts, such as silks and spices, which were valued more highly than the goods offered in the Byzantine markets.
The title of "capital of fashion" was transferred, from then on, from Constantinople to Paris.
The pinnacle of the Gothic style took place in the period between the 10th and 14th centuries.
In the beginning, the form of dress received great influence from the Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to the slowness of the communication channels, western styles could take a delay of about 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop a style of its own. One of the most significant advances of that time was that, as a result of the Crusades, people began to use buttons to fasten their clothes.
Agriculture of subsistence is understood to be that which aims to produce enough food to feed only the needs of the farmer and his family.
The subsistence agriculture is a simple practice, usually organic, that combines the use of stored seeds from the region's ecoregion with the rotation of crops or other comparatively simple methods to maximize production.
Historically, most of the principal activity of farmers was subsistence farming, which is still practiced in many countries in the process of development.
The subcultures congregate individuals with similar ideas and feelings of marginality due to social standards and provides them with the opportunity to generate a sense of identity.
There are many factors that can distinguish subcultures: age, ethnicity, class, location, or gender of their members.
The traits that distinguish a subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, sexual, geographical, or related to religion or politics, or a mixture of factors.
It is common for members of a subculture to exhibit traits of their belonging to this by resorting to distinctive and symbolic use of style, such as fashions, gestures, and jargon.
One of the most commonly used mechanisms for graphing the importance of socializing is to analyze the few and lamentable cases of children who, through negligence, bad luck, or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults during their growth.
These children are called "wild". Some wild children are confined by people, usually their parents. In some cases, the abandonment of a child is due to the rejection of the parents of a child with a severe intellectual or physical disability.
It is possible that the wild children may have suffered traumatic or severe abuse before being abandoned or running away.
It is said that others were raised by animals and that some have lived on their own in the wild.
When the wild child is raised exclusively by animals different from humans, it presents behaviors (within its physical possibilities) almost equal to those of the specific animal that cared for it, as well as its fear or indifference towards people.
Even though learning based on projects should make the process easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a bit further.
The scaffolding is not a learning technique; it is, rather, a support that provides assistance to those who are going through a new experience, such as the use of a new computer program or the beginning of a new project.
The scaffolding can be presented either in a real or virtual format; to put it another way, a teacher is a type of scaffolding, but also is the small animated subject of Microsoft Office.
The andamiajes virtuales are incorporated into the software and their function is to question, stimulate or explain procedures that may have been difficult for the student to understand on their own.
Children are welcomed into foster homes for a wide variety of reasons, from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment where there is no love, care or education; but it happens.
We can perceive that the system of foster care provides a safe environment for these children.
The objective of our foster care system is to provide safe homes, loving foster parents, sustained education, and reliable medical care.
The objective of the foster home is to cover all the needs that were not met in the home from which the child was removed.
The Internet unites and mixes components of the mass communication and between people.
The different traits that characterize the Internet open the way to new dimensions from the perspective of the concept of uses and rewards.
For example, James et al. (1995) have pointed out the “learning” and “socialization” as significant incentives for the use of the Internet.
During a study of the reactions of users to web sites conducted by Eighmey and McCord (1998), it was also detected the "personal participation" and the "durable relationships" as new motivational factors.
Through the recording of videos, important discoveries have been made in the interpretation of micorexpressions, which are movements in the face lasting only a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is claimed that, through the correct reading of its microexpressions, it is possible to detect if a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his article "The President's Speech", explained how those who cannot understand speech due to a brain injury can, nevertheless, evaluate the sincerity of the speaker with precision.
He also suggests that the ability to interpret human behavior can be shared with animals, such as domesticated dogs.
Through the research of the 20th century, it has been demonstrated that there are two types of genetic variation: the hidden and the manifest.
The process of mutation incorporates a new genetic variation; the process of selection removes that variation from that set of variations.
Segregation and recombination barter the variation between one generation and the next.
In the savannah, it is not easy for a primate, whose digestive system is the same as that of a human, to satisfy its amino acid needs with the plant resources available to it.
In fact, not doing it can cause serious problems: stunted growth, malnutrition and, in the end, death.
The proteins present in the leaves and legumes would have been the easiest source of vegetable protein, but they are not easily digestible for primates like us, except when cooked.
On the other hand, the foods derived from animals (ants, termites, eggs) are easy to digest and provide a large number of proteins that contain all the essential amino acids.
In the end, it shouldn't surprise us if our own ancestors solved their "protein problems" in the same way that chimpanzees in the savannah do today.
The interruption of sleep consists of waking up on purpose during the normal sleep period and then going back to sleep after a short time (10 to 60 minutes).
This can be easily achieved with a soft alarm clock, which will return you to a conscious state without waking you up completely.
The record is an additional requirement for the visa process. In some countries, you will have to register your presence and the address of your accommodation with the local authorities.
Other options that are based on the biological rhythm consist of drinking a lot of liquid (especially water or tea, known diuretic) before going to bed, which will oblige you to get up to urinate.
The level of inner peace that a person enjoys is inversely related to the amount of tension that they have in their body and in their spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive is the force of life with which we have to do. Each one of us has the potential of finding peace and absolute happiness.
We can all reach enlightenment. The only thing that gets in the way is our tension and negativity.
Although the foundations of Tibetan Buddhism are the teachings of Buddha, they spread through the path of loving-kindness Mahayana and numerous techniques of yoga from India.
In general terms, laísmo is very simple. It is based on the kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of love that encompasses everything.
In Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (illumination) is activated with yoga postures, breathing practices, mantras or visualizations.
Tibetan meditation focuses on the Devata Yoga. Through the visualization of different deities, the channels of energy can be unstuck, the chakras can be activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment can be developed.
The cooperation between the U.S.S.R. and the U.S. was the result of facing a common enemy, Germany, during the Second World War. After the war, the clashes of system, process and culture ended up by distancing the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, those who had been allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and would be fought for in earnest, through substitute militias, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, among many other places.
Due to the fact that for the 17th of September of 1939 the Polish defense was already broken, its only hope was to give the retreat and reorganize itself in the extension of the Romanian head of the bridge.
However, these planes fell into disuse almost overnight, when more than 800,000 Red Army soldiers from the Soviet Union invaded and formed the fronts of Belarus and Ukraine after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Treaty of Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, the bilateral and multilateral agreements, and other international, bilateral, and multilateral agreements.
Using ships to transport goods is a much more efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across the oceans.
Since always, the function of the navy has been to guarantee that its country keeps the ability to transport its population and goods, while at the same time interfering with the enemy's ability to do the same.
The campaign of the North Atlantic in the Second World War offers one of the clearest and most recent examples of this. The Americans were trying to transport men and materials across the Atlantic with the aim of supporting Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly submarines, was trying to cut off this circulation.
If the Allies had not been successful, Germany could have taken power in Britain, just as it did with the other European countries.
Apparently, goats were domesticated, for the first time, about 10 000 years ago, in the Zagros Mountains, in Iran.
With the purpose of easily obtaining their milk, hair, meat, and leather, the ancient peoples and tribes started to hunt them.
In general, domestic goats were kept in herds that roamed the hills or other areas of pasture, tended by herdsmen who were often children or teenagers, similar to the most popular shepherd.
In England, railways had already been installed in the 16th century.
Even though the rails of the carriages were made of simple parallel planks of wood, they allowed the horses pulling them to achieve a greater speed and pull heavier loads than they could on the rougher roads of the day.
The incorporation of sleepers to maintain the rails in their place took place quite early. However, gradually, it was realized that the rails would be more efficient if they were covered with iron on their upper part.
This became a common practice, although the iron caused greater wear on the wheels of the wagons, which were made of wood.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels and, in 1767, iron rails were used for the first time.
The first form of transportation known was walking. Humans began to walk upright about two million years ago with the appearance of the Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, didn't have the habit of walking upright.
While fossil footprints of bipedalism have been found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, it is possible that Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs 7 million years ago.
We can begin to live a more friendly life with the planet, form part of environmentalist movements or, even, we can become activists and fight to reduce, in some way, the suffering of the future.
It is, in many cases, like the asintomatic treatment. But if we are not only looking for a temporary situation, we should try to find the root of the problems and try to deactivate them.
It is obvious that the world has undergone great changes, as a result of the technological and scientific advances of humanity, and the problems have intensified due to the overpopulation and extravagant lifestyle of people.
After being approved by the Congress on the 4th of July, a handwritten draft was sent to the printer, John Dunlap, a few blocks away.
Copies were made, during the night, between 150 and 200, which are now known as the "Dunlap Copies".
It was John Nixon who read the document for the first time, and he did so in the patio of the Independence Hall, on July 8.
On the 6th of July, a copy was sent to George Washington, who ordered that it be read to his army in New York on the 9th of July. On the 10th of August, another copy arrived in London.
The 25 photographs of Dunlap, which are known to still exist, are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original manuscript has been lost.
A large number of paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive today. They are birds.
Many people don't represent them as dinosaurs, because they have feathers and can fly.
However, there are many characteristics in birds that still make them look like dinosaurs.
They have scaly extremities and claws, lay eggs, and move on their hind legs in the same way as the T-Rex.
Currently, almost all computers function in base to the manipulation of data coded under the binary system.
A binary number can only have one of two values, they are the 0 and the 1, and, according to the computer jargon, these numbers are known as binary digits, or bits.
The internal poisoning may not be evident immediately. Its symptoms, such as vomiting, are too common to be able to give an immediate diagnosis.
The clearest indicator of internal poisoning is finding an open bottle of medicines or cleaning products containing toxic chemicals.
Read the label to get information about the specific first aid measures for that specific poison.
Entomologists use the term "parasitic insect" in a formal sense to refer to this group of arthropods.
The word comes from its ancient relationship with chinches, a very developed species to parasitize humans.
The bedbugs and the clothesbugs are nidicolous; they are adapted to live in the nest or home of their host.
About 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) are reported in the U.S. each year, making it the most common neurological disease among young adults and middle-aged adults.
The central nervous system, consisting of the brain, the spinal cord, and the optic nerve, is the object of attack in multiple sclerosis.
The studies indicate that women have twice the probability of men to suffer from EM.
A couple could conclude that raising a child wouldn't be the most convenient thing for them or for the child.
These couples could choose to plan the adoption of a baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents renounce their parental rights so that a different couple can take care of the child.
The main objective of science is to decipher the way the world works through the scientific method. Indeed, this method serves as a guide for the majority of scientific investigations.
However, it is not an experiment, it is a test that is used to discard one or more of the possible hypotheses, making questions and observations that guide the scientific investigation.
The focus of both naturalists and philosophers was put on the classical works; especially, on the Latin version of the biblical text.
Aristotle's thoughts on science, especially those on the subject of psychology, were accepted.
As the dominion of the Greek language was declining, the West distanced itself from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Often, many rhythms present in physiological processes and in the behavior depend decisively on internal cycles and their production through biological clocks.
The periodic rhythms, which are not only reactions to external stimuli, have been recorded in almost all living beings, even in bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks oscillate in a self-sustaining manner and have a free-running period, even if there are no external stimuli.
One of the key indicators that DNA consisted of a type of genetic material was the experiment conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase inserted their own DNA into a bacterium using phages, or viruses.
They carried out two experiments in which they marked the DNA of the frog with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the DNA with radioactive sulfur.
Depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether it involves germinal cells, the mutation can have various effects.
Only mutations in germinal cells can be transmitted to children, while mutations in other parts of the body can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism usually attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, which includes wild animal and plant life.
Some examples of possible activities in the place are: hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visits to parks, and study of information about the ecosystem.
An example is to visit, take photographs, and learn about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in their cars to go to their jobs, and they often cross paths with other people whose jobs are in the place from which they just came.
In this dynamic transfer vehicle, everyone is somehow connected with a transport system based on the use of private cars, and they support it.
Currently, scientists argue that this massive release of carbon has deprived the biosphere of one of its regular states that has contributed to the evolution of humanity for the last two million years.
All of them are part of the society and make use of the transport systems; and almost all of them complain about them.
In developed countries, it is not common to hear complaints about the quality of water or the collapse of bridges.
What is the reason that transportation systems give rise to such complaints and why do they fail so often? Are the engineers of transportation simply incompetent? Or is there something more substantial going on?
The flow of traffic is the study of the individual movement of drivers and vehicles between two points and of their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, it is not an easy task to study the flow of traffic, since it is not possible to make exact predictions about the behavior of drivers.
Fortunately, there is a tendency in conductors to maintain a relatively consistent behavior, which allows traffic flows to have a logical consistency and to be represented approximately by mathematical models.
In order to graph more clearly the flow of circulation, relations were established between the three most important elements: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships facilitate both planning and design, as well as the operations of vehicular devices.
The first species to take flight were insects. This helped them to evade their enemies more easily and to find food and a mate more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back, sticking them to the sides of their bodies.
This gives them a wider range of possible small places to hide from predators.
Currently, the anisoptera and the ephemeroptera are the only insects that are unable to fold their wings.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus commented that the Solar System revolved around the Sun.
There were those who shared his theory, but many others believed the opposite: that the solar system revolved around the Earth, even the Sun and other stars.
This seems to make sense, since on Earth we don't perceive its movement, correct?
The Amazon river is the most caudalous and the second most extensive river in the world. It contains 8 times more water than the river that follows it in size.
In addition, the Amazon River is the widest river in the world, in some places with a width of up to six miles.
Of the total amount of water that comes from the rivers of the world that flow into the oceans, 20 percent comes from the Amazon.
The great Amazon River has a length of 6387 km (3980 miles) and receives water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although pyramids of stone continued to be built until the end of the Ancient Kingdom, they never surpassed the size or the sublime technique of their construction.
The ancient Egyptian people of the New Empire were amazed by the monuments of their ancestors, which at that time were more than a thousand years old.
With approximately 800 inhabitants, the Vatican City is the smallest independent country in the world and the smallest country in terms of population.
The Italian is used in the Vatican City, both to draft its legislation and to issue its official communiqués.
The language that is spoken daily by the majority of those who work within the state is also Italian, and the use of Latin is generally reserved for religious ceremonies.
The entire population of citizens who live in the Vatican adheres to the Roman Catholic religion.
The basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper have been known since antiquity, since all of them can be found in nature in their original form and are relatively easy to extract with rudimentary tools.
The philosopher Aristotle developed the theory that everything is made up of a combination of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
It had a greater similarity with the states of matter (with the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, but, at the same time, it had the theory that they transform into new substances that form the things that we see.
Alloys are, basically, a combination of two or more metals. Remember that the periodic table has many elements.
Metals are considered to be elements such as calcium and potassium. From now on, there are also metals of the type of gold and silver.
It is also possible that there are alloys with the presence of small amounts of carbon, which are not metals.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter, composed of very small particles called atoms.
The size of the atoms is so impressively small that the end of this sentence could contain billions of them.
Because of this, when the pencil was invented, it gained many friends.
Unfortunately, as a result of the implementation of new methods of writing, the pencil is used less and has lost its status.
Today, people write messages on the screens of their computers. They don't even need to get close to a pencil.
The only thing left to ask is what will happen to the keyboard when something new comes along.
The atomic bomb works on the principle that it requires energy to form a nucleus with a large number of protons and neutrons.
It's similar to what happens when you roll a heavy cart up a hill. By dividing the nucleus once more, it releases some of that energy.
The nuclei of some atoms are unstable, that is, they tend to disintegrate with a minimum or almost no push.
The surface of the moon is composed of rocks and dust and its outer layer is called the crust.
The crust has a thickness of about 70 km on the near side and about 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under the lunar seas and thicker under the highlands.
It is possible that there are more seas on the side facing us due to the fact that its crust is thinner, which made it easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
The theories of content focus on finding out what attracts or pleases people.
These theories hold that people have certain needs or desires that have been internalized as they grew up until they reached maturity.
These theories analyze what causes some people to want certain things and what factors in their environment force them to do or not to do certain things.
Two very well-known theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs, and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, there are two types of behavior when managers begin to lead their former colleagues. On one side of the spectrum, there is the attempt to continue being “one of the boys” (or girls).
It is difficult for managers in this category to make decisions that are unpopular with their employees, to impose disciplinary measures, to carry out performance evaluations, to assign responsibilities and to demand accountability from their staff.
On the other end of the spectrum, it mutates into a person who believes it is necessary to change everything that has been done until now and do it in its own way.
In the end, the ultimate success or failure of the team is the responsibility of the leader.
This way of behaving many times ends up distancing the leaders from the other members of the team.
The same standards of excellence that apply to conventional equipment also apply to virtual equipment, although there are some small differences.
Often, the members of a virtual team operate as a point of contact for their physical team.
In general, they enjoy greater autonomy than members of a traditional group, because it is possible for their teams to meet according to different time zones that, for example, might not be understood by the local management.
The existence of a "real invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also an exclusive element of virtual teams.
The "invisible team" is the group in charge of management and to which each member reports. It is the one that sets the standards for each member.
What motive could there be for an organization to submit itself to the demanding process of establishing an organization of learning? One of the purposes of applying the theoretical concepts of organizational learning is to promote innovation.
When all of the available resources are used appropriately in the operational departments of an organization, there is space for creativity and ingenuity.
As a result of this, it is possible that an organization that works as a team to overcome a difficulty in place to a new innovative process in order to meet the needs of customers.
In order for an organization to be innovative, the leadership must first generate a culture of innovation, as well as a shared knowledge base and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuous focus approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
The neurobiological data offer factual evidence for a theoretical approach to cognitive research. They therefore reduce the field of research and give it greater precision.
The correlation that exists between brain pathology and behavior contributes to the research of scientists.
For a long time, it has been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors can affect behavior and cause changes in mental functions.
Thanks to new technologies, we now have the opportunity to see and investigate structures and processes in the brain that have never been seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to develop simulation models, which help us to understand the mental processes.
Although artificial intelligence is often associated with science fiction, it is a speciality of great relevance within computer science, which is responsible for the behaviour, learning and adaptation of intelligent machines.
The research in the field of AI implies the development of machines in order to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples of this are, among others, monitoring, planning and programming, the ability to respond to diagnostic and consultation requests from customers, as well as facial recognition, handwriting, and voice recognition.
These questions have become separate disciplines, focused on offering solutions to real-world problems.
The system of Artificial Intelligence is now often used in the economy, medicine, engineering and military, in the same way that it was incorporated into various applications of video games and personal computers.
Study trips are an important part of every classroom. It is very common for a teacher to want to take her students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
The solution comes from the hand of technology, through virtual excursions. Students can observe the objects exhibited in a museum, visit an aquarium, or contemplate beautiful works of art sitting with their class.
Sharing a virtual field trip is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, the students of the Bennet School in North Carolina design a web page about their trip to the capital of the state and each year the page is updated, but the previous versions are kept online as an album of memories.
Blogs can also contribute to improving the writing of students. Even though students usually begin their blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, this usually changes in the presence of an audience.
Due to the fact that students tend to be the readers who most criticize, the writer of blogs begins to make an effort to improve his writing, in order to avoid criticism.
Likewise, blogging requires that students be more understanding of the world that surrounds them. The need to arouse the interest of the audience inspires them to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a resource that inspire collaboration and encourage students to go deeper in their learning beyond the typical school day.
The appropriate use of blogs "can empower students to be more analytical and critical, through the active response to the contents of the Internet, they can define their positions in the context of the writings of others, and establish their perspectives on specific topics." (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the captivating bilingual capital of Canada and is home to a variety of museums and art galleries that exhibit the history and the present of the country.
The Niagara Falls are located more to the south and the north hosts the natural beauty without exploiting Muskoka and the extension that follows.
All of these aspects, among others, are what make Ontario intrinsically Canadian to the eyes of foreigners.
The large areas most towards the north are sparsely populated and some are wild lands, almost uninhabited.
To make a comparison of population that causes great surprise to many: there are more African-Americans in the United States than in Canada.
The location of the islands of East Africa is in front of the eastern coast of that continent, in the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar is, by far, the largest and a continent in itself if we are talking about wild life.
The majority of the smaller islands are independent states or associated with France and are popular for their beaches and luxury resorts.
The Islam was also brought to the lands by the Arabs and it was imposed, to a large extent, in the Comoros and Mayotte.
The beginning of the European influence and colonialism took place in the 15th century, following the discovery, by the Portuguese explorer, Vasco da Gama, of the route that unites the Cape of Good Hope with India.
The region limits with the Sahel to the north, and with the Atlantic Ocean to the south and the west.
Women: It is recommended that all female visitors say they are married, regardless of their real marital status.
It will also be useful to use a ring (just make sure it doesn't look too expensive).
Women need to be aware that cultural differences can provoke what they consider harassment, and that it is not uncommon for them to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be round in rejecting men and don't be afraid to defend your position (cultural differences or not, that's not correct!).
The founders of the modern city of Casablanca were the Berber fishermen during the 10th century B.C. and the Phoenicians, Romans and Carthaginians used it as a strategic port, called Anfa.
It was destroyed and rebuilt by the Portuguese with the name of the White House, but in 1755 they abandoned it after the occurrence of an earthquake.
The city was rebuilt by order of the Moroccan sultan with the name of Daru l-Badya and the Spanish traders who set up their businesses in that place called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the most boring places to go shopping in all of Morocco.
In the surrounding area of the old Medina, there are many places where you can buy traditional Moroccan goods, such as earthenware pots, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes and a whole range of knick-knacks, although everything is geared towards tourists.
Goma is a tourist destination in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, close to Rwanda.
In 2002, the lava of the volcano Nyiragongo destroyed Goma and left much of its streets submerged, especially in the center of the city.
While Goma is relatively safe, any visit to the outside must be considered in order to take stock of the situation in the province of Kivu in the north.
In addition, the city is the base for climbing the volcano Nyiragongo and its gorilla-viewing excursions are among the most economical in Africa.
To get to Goma, you can take a boda-boda (mototaxi). The regular (local) fare is CDF500 (Congolese francs) for a short trip.
In addition, the fact that it is relatively inaccessible has given "Tombuctú" the image of an exotic and distant land.
Even though today Tombuctú is a poor city, it still has an airport and its reputation makes it an attractive tourist destination.
In 1990, it was included in the list of World Heritage Sites in danger, as a result of the threat posed by desert sands.
It was one of the most important stops on the special Maravillas del mundo africano, by Henry Louis Gates, Jr., on PBS.
The city contrasts a lot with the rest of the country, as it has a more Arab style than African.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and extends along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park has a surface area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 ecoregions, in each of which a different wild life is developed.
This is one of the most important attractions in South Africa and is recognized as the main icon of the National Parks of South Africa (SANParks).
As in all the natural reserves of South Africa, there are daily fees for conservation and access to the park.
It can also be convenient to buy a Wild Card that allows entry to selected parks in South Africa or to all the National Parks in the country.
The territory of Hong Kong takes its name from the island of Hong Kong, which is the destination of most tourists who consider it the main attraction.
It has been compared the deployment of buildings that delimit the horizon of Hong Kong with a graph of luminous bars that is evidenced by the presence of the waters of the Victoria Harbour.
The best way to enjoy the best views of Hong Kong is to leave the island and go to the Kowloon side, which is located in front.
It is in the reclaimed lands of the northern coast of Hong Kong where its urban development is most densely concentrated.
This is the site that the British conquerors adopted as their own. Therefore, if you wish to see evidence of the past colonial history of this region, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove forest in the world, with a length of 80 km (50 miles) from the coast to the interior of Bangladesh and India.
The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has declared the Sundarbans to be a World Heritage Site.
Although this is true, the forests are not only mangroves, but also some of the last trees that remain of the imposing jungles that once covered the Gangetic plains.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2 and about a third of its extension is covered by water or swampy areas.
The Sundarbans have been, since 1966, a temple of wild life and it is estimated that there are currently 400 tigers in the area and about 30 000 spotted deer.
The buses depart from the bus station between districts (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although the majority, especially those that travel east and to Jakar (also called Bumthang), leave between 6:30 and 7:30 a.m.
Due to the fact that buses between districts are usually full of passengers, it is recommended to buy a ticket with a few days of advance.
Most of the districts have the Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and durable.
Sharing a taxi ride is a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (150 ngultrums) and Punakha (200 ngultrums).
The bridge of the Oyapock river is a cantilever bridge that crosses it, connecting Oiapoque, Brazil, and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 m, with a length of 378 m and two lanes of 3.5 m width.
Below the bridge there is a free space of 15 meters and, although its construction was completed in August of 2011, it was not opened for traffic until March of 2017.
The full operation of the bridge is estimated for September 2017, which is when it is expected that the Brazilian customs controls will be completed.
The area that now constitutes the east of Paraguay was inhabited by the guaraníes, who were the most important indigenous group in that region and who lived as nomadic hunters, in addition to practicing subsistence agriculture.
The Guaycurú and Payaguá indigenous groups lived in the region, for example, who hunted, gathered and fished as a means of subsistence.
Paraguay, formerly known as "The giant province of the Indies", was born in the 16th century, as a result of the encounter between the Spanish conquerors and the native Indian peoples.
The Spaniards started the stage of colonization, which lasted for three centuries.
Since Asunción was established, in 1537, Paraguay has been able to conserve a good part of its aboriginal identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and the best polo players in the world.
The most important tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
You can also see other tournaments and lower-level games in other parts of the year.
