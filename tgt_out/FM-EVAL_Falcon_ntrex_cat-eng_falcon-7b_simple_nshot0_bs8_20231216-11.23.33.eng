Members of the Galician Parliament concerned about the "Muppets" identity
Some members of the assembly have expressed their consternation at the proposal to change the title of the assembly to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This debate has arisen from the change of name of the Parliament to the Galician Parliament.
All members of the General Assembly of all political parties have shown their concern that this measure could become a joke.
A member of the Labour Party has said that his party is worried about the fact that MWP is "linked to Twp or Pwp".
For those readers who are not familiar with the Catalan language: In Catalan, twp means stupid and, pwp, excrement.
A member of Plaid Cymru's Assembly group has commented that the party "hasn't got the right people" and has proposed various alternatives.
For the conservative wing, a member has affirmed that the group is showing “openness” in front of the change of name, but he will also comment that there is a big difference between the terms “MWP” and “Muppet”.
In this context, I would say that the letter “w” in galician is pronounced like the letter “u” in English from Yorkshire.
According to the committee of the assembly charged with drafting the legal text to introduce the changes: “The final decision on the qualification of any member will be made by the assembly members themselves.”
The 2017 Law of the Government of Galicia grants the Galician Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the committee will publish the results of a public consultation on the proposals, with a wide support for the proposal to change the name of the assembly to the Parliament of Galicia.
The title of the members of the assembly, even if the committee is going to decide for “Members of the parliament” or “WPM”, the option of “MWP” is the one that is going to have a wider support in the public consultation.
The members of the assembly seem to be suggesting different alternatives. However, it is clear that the only way to solve this problem is to follow the legal procedure for the changes in the constitution. The President of the assembly, Elin Jones, is expected to present the legal basis for the changes in the constitution in the coming weeks.
The legislation on reforms will include other changes related to the functioning of the assembly, such as rules on disqualification of its members and the design of the committee system.
The members of the assembly will celebrate the final vote on the name during the debate related to the legislation.
The Macedonians will vote in a referendum on whether to change the name of their country
The Catalan Ciutadans party will hold a referendum on Sunday to decide whether to change the name of the country to “Republic of Macedonia of the North”.
The popular consultation will decide on a resolution to resolve a dispute that has been going on for decades with Greece, which already has a province named Macedonia.
The Catalan government has insisted for a long time that the name of the president of the north represents a way of claiming the territory and has repeatedly opposed the intentions of this country to join the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian president, Gjorge Ivanov, has said that he will ignore the referendum on the name.
The ones who are in favor, like the Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, think that the change of name is simply the price that must be paid to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's stop ringing: the difficulties of the churches of Harlem
“Historically, the people here have always been able to speak of a bar and a church in each village”, says the Sr. Adams.
“Today, in the day, there is no difference between the two.”
According to Adams, the disappearance of bars is possible to understand.
“The people have another way of socialising today”, he says.
“The bars have already been closed down because the people have already been going out to the countryside on a regular basis”.
The thing that worries the churches, is that the dinners that are being sold from the sale of acts, do not last as long as the leaders predict, “and that they will be late at the place where they are going to leave”.
The churches, could be replaced, by buildings of apartments and condominiums, with the type of people who will not be helped by the temples that remain in the barri.
“The vast majority of people who will live in these buildings will be white”, he says, “and because of that, the process of de-Christianization will accelerate even more, because it is unlikely that the majority of the people who will move to these buildings will be members of these churches.”
Two churches were built for white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis; the Metropolitan Community Church in 1870 and St. Martin's in 1872.
The white Methodist congregation that had been established in the 30s.
A black congregation that has been here for a long time is going to buy the building.
St. Martin's will pass to a black congregation led by the Reverend John Howard Johnson, who will direct a boycott of merchants on 125th Street, one of the principal commercial streets of Harlem, which is resisting contracts or promotions of Negroes.
The 1939 fire caused great damage to the building, and when the Reverend Johnson and his congregation decided to rebuild, they hired an architect to design the new building.
The Reverend David Johnson, son of the Reverend Johnson and successor to the Reverend Johnson at St. Martin's, will describe the pride of the poor in the bells of the poor.
The expert who will lead the search for the treasure on July 1st will describe it in a different way: “A cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument”.
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, will also observe that the first carillon of the world that will be touched by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who will be playing on the largest carillon in Riverside Church for 18 years.
According to the Sr. Merriweather, St. Martin's will substitute.
The one who has sounded the bells at St. Martin's during the last two months, on the contrary, has been the complicated history of architects and contractors, some of them carried by the lay leaders of the church and others by the diocese episcopal.
The council, the parish’s governing body, formed by lay leaders, will write to the diocese in July to express its concern that the diocese “pretends to transfer the costs” to the parish, and that the parish will not be involved in the contracting of the architects and contractors that the diocese will send.
Some faithful have complained about the lack of transparency in the diocese.
A 13-year-old boy was killed by a bull while searching for a lost ball in California
A bull is going to attack and injure a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while he was fishing for lobsters in California, the first day of the season for lobster fishing, according to the authorities.
The atac will be held just before 7 am on the morning of the 7th of May at Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
According to Chad Hammel at KSWB-TV in San Diego, he was on the air for about an hour this morning talking about a new device that can help people with disabilities. The group was there to help a man who was trapped in the water.
He thought he was going to be happy when he caught a lobster, but then he realized that he had caught a lobster.
I had all my collarbone stripped
“Because everyone is coming out of the water, I shouted: 'There is a bull in the water!'”, said Hammel.
The child will be transported by air to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, we will be in a difficult state.
I don't know which bull is responsible for the attack.
In a press conference, the paramedic Larry Giles will say that the bull had been detected in the area for a few weeks, but that it was decided that this species was not dangerous.
Giles will add that the victim suffered head trauma in the upper part of the body.
The authorities will close the beaches from 8:00 am to 8:00 pm for the next 48 hours due to the investigation and for security reasons.
Giles will mark that there are more than 135 species of bull in the area, but that the majority of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans, to the market of the products of the beautiful of the United Kingdom
Sainsbury's has decided to compete with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beauty products in the style of the big department stores.
These great steps are only one part of a considerable investment in the beauty products market in the United Kingdom, a market that is worth £2.8 billion and which continues to grow, while the fashion and beauty sectors are doing well, and we will be able to prove this by opening 11 new stores in the country this year.
The investment in beauty products is the investment in the desire of the super markets to profit from the space available to them to offer their services that were previously destined for televisions, microones and products of the hearth.
Sainsbury's says it will double its beauty offer by adding 3000 different products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also have a wider range of shades.
The company of supermarkets is also in the phase of expanding its range of products for makeup, so that the majority of the products are suitable for vegans, a feature that is increasingly demanded by consumers.
The Fragrance Shop, a major chain of perfume shops, will open concessions in two Sainsbury's stores. The first will open next week in Croydon, south of London, while the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
The supermarkets and the big food companies have found a way to convince the people to buy more food in smaller quantities every day. They have found other ways to convince the people to buy more food.
According to Mike Coupe, director executive of Sainsbury's, the supermarkets will be assembling more and more large stores in one go in an attempt to counter the supermercats of Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has introduced price points from Argos in many of its stores, as well as Habitat, which it is acquiring in its entirety.
The intent of the chain of supermercats to relaunch the beauty and pharmacy departments will result in a failure.
Sainsbury's is to trial a joint operation with Boots in the first quarter of 2000, but it is expected to end in failure shortly afterwards.
This new strategy above after the sale of Sainsbury's of three years ago for 281 pharmacies to LloydsPharmacy, owner of the chain LloydsPharmacy, for 125 million GBP.
According to Sainsbury's, Lloyds will have a very important paper in the global market, as it will expand the range of luxury brands of products for the skin, such as La Roche-Posay or Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, comments: "We have changed the appearance of our past products of beauty to improve the environment for our customers."
The Catalan government has decided to hire 3,000 new workers to help with the assessment process.
Our range of brands is designed to meet any need; on the other hand, the environment and location make us follow a very popular trend for beauty products and we are the first to offer them in a new way.
Peter Jones “furious” after Holly Willoughby is paid £11 million
Dragons' Den star Peter Jones is furious after the presenter of the TV show Holly Willoughby is featured in a £11 million deal to promote a lifestyle brand of his
Willoughby has no time to devote to the joint negotiation of products from the oven and accessories Truly.
The negotiation of these two media personalities had arrived at the mark Goop of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The presenter of This Morning, aged 37, is going to use Instagram to announce her marriage.
Holly Willoughby has left the Dragons' Den Peter Jones furious in the last minute of the deal to sell his lifestyle brand to Marks & Spencer and ITV, which will also report large benefits.
According to various sources, Jones was "furious" when the red star of television admitted, during a tense meeting held on Tuesday at the headquarters of his empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that the contracts of the presenter, for a value of 1.5 million pounds, would imply that he would no longer have time to devote to the joint brand of products of the oven and accessories Truly.
The negotiation had arrived at comparing with the brand Goop of Gwyneth Paltrow and it wanted to double the fortune of Willoughby, estimated in 11 million GBP.
Quan Willoughby, 37 years old, will use Instagram to announce his marriage to Truly, Jones will take a private plane to one of his vacation homes outside the United Kingdom.
According to a font: “Truly was the main priority of Holly.
Was destined to be his future and we would see it during the next 30 or 40 years.
His decision to go back to the field will leave no room for words for all the parties involved.
No one could believe that it was going to happen on Tuesday, we were so close...
There is a shop in Marlow with a lot of goods to be sold
According to the experts, the market value of the presenter of This Morning, one of the most recognizable stars in the United Kingdom, could cost the company millions of pounds due to the important investment in products, from coixins and mirrors to roba and roba, and the possibility of delays in the launch.
It could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been keeping a close relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp during the past two years.
Willoughby will found a new Catalan government with Capp and Jones, both 52 years old, in March.
Two pairs of identical twins are spending their holidays together. In addition, Jones has a 40% share in the production of television by Baldwin.
Willoughby will be the proper ambassador of Marks & Spencer and will replace Ant McPartlin as the presenter of the ITV show I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!
A proper font for Jones to comment on is “We will not comment on the negotiations”.
Hard accusations... "and then we will fall in love"
I will make fun of the possible critics that will come from part of the media for making a comment that some consider “not appropriate for a president” and for having such a positive opinion of the North Korean leader.
Why has Trump renounced so much?
Trump will say, totally make fun of the news presenter of the day:
“No he renunciat a la res”.
You will notice that Kim had an interest in celebrating a second meeting after the first meeting held in Singapore in June was declared a great success in the denuclearization of North Korea.
The nuclear negotiations are stuck.
After the three-day summit in Singapore, the North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho will comment on Saturday to the leaders of the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea does not see a “proportionate response” from the United States to its first initiatives for disarmament.
The United States will continue to apply sanctions with the objective of maintaining pressure.
Trump's view, in change, was much more optimistic in his speech.
“I am very happy to be here in North Korea,” he said.
“We declare war on North Korea.”
Millions of people have lost their lives.
I am maintaining this great relationship.
According to Trump, his efforts to improve relations with Kim have had positive results: we have proof of missile launches, aid for the release of hostages and the return of the remains of American soldiers.
I will defend the usual focus of speaking about the relations with Kim.
“It’s very easy to be president, but when you have 10,000 people trying to get into this place, you need a lot of people, and we have about 200.”
An island destroyed and hundreds of deaths caused by a tsunami and an earthquake in Indonesia
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, it will be said to the non-governmental organizations in other countries that they were not necessary.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok will be displaced, the government will not declare a national disaster, but will ask for international aid to help the victims.
“Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it clear that they do not want international assistance, so the situation is very urgent”, says Mrs. Sumbung.
If Save the Children is organizing a team to go to Palu, it is not sure that foreign people can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, head of the National Disaster Management Agency, will comment on the situation in Palu, Indonesia, where the authorities are assessing whether it is possible or not for international agencies to provide assistance.
Give the constant earthquakes that happen in Indonesia, the country is not prepared for the wrath of nature.
Although Aceh has built tsunami refuges, they are not common in other coastal areas.
The apparent lack of sirens in Palu in case of tsunami, even though there was an alert in force, is very likely to have contributed to the number of deaths.
Moving between the enormous quantity of islands in Indonesia, in the best of the cases, it is a reptile.
The natural disasters make it more difficult to manage the logistics.
A rescue ship that was trying to reach Lombok to help the victims of the earthquake is now heading to Palu; meanwhile, it will take at least three days to arrive at the site of the new disaster.
The president Joko Widodo had the central element of his campaign electoral in the betterment of the infraestructura of Indonesia, and he invested enormously in the carretes and the railways.
The Catalan government is facing a crisis because of the huge deficit in the budget.
Joko also faced the pressure of the permanent tensions between the country's two main sects, the majority of Muslims have adopted a more conservative faith.
More than 1000 deaths and thousands of displacements are the result of the clashes that are taking place on the roads between Christian and Muslim bands with arrows, crossbows and other blood-shedding weapons.

The statue of Cromwell from the British Parliament is the latest to be defaced by the “rewriting history” movement
His disappearance would be a matter of poetic justice for the destruction of so many cultural and religious objects in England by the puritanical fanatics who followed him.
The Cromwell Society has described the proposal of Crick as a “bogeria” and an “intent to rewrite history”.
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, comments: "In the debate about the removal of statues, it was inevitable that the figure of Oliver Cromwell would become one of the main objects of discussion.
The iconoclasm of the English civil wars will not be ordered nor directed to a conclusion by Cromwell.
Perhaps the Cromwell will be sacrificed by the incorrect actions of the previous one who will do during the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a proof of the opinion of the 19th century and of the historiography of a figure that many people think is worthy of being commemorated.
Goldsmith is going to tell The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps most, at the end of the 19th century as a defender of the parliament against external pressure, in his case obviously of the monarchy."
If this fet constitutes or not a totally accurate representation of Roman history.
The one who is sure is that the conflict of media of the seventeenth century will be the one that will form the future development of our nation, and Cromwell is a figure that represents a band of this division.
The Lord Protector's assoliments are also worthy of being celebrated and commemorated.
A pig killed a farmer
A pig was attacked and killed in a market in the south-west of Catalonia, according to local sources.
The man, identified only by his surname Yuan, was found dead with a deep cut in his left arm and covered in blood, like a pig at the market in Liupanshui, the provincial capital of Guizhou, according to a report by the South China Morning Post.
On May 30, 2005, a farmer was preparing to inject pigs with vaccines in a courtyard in Xining, Qinghai Province.
The man who had come from Yunan province to sell 15 pigs on Wednesday had gone to the market.
The next morning, the boy found the dead man and discovered a door that led to a pigsty.
According to what he said, there was a big pig with blood on its mouth.
The forensic examination will confirm that the garrí of 250 kg had killed the farmer, according to the information.
“My wife had her breasts cut off and filled with blood”, the wife said, with the surname “Wu”, according to the news of the evening of Guiyang.
The scenes recorded by the security camera show Yuan entering the market at 4:40 in the morning on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His/her/its cat will be found approximately one hour later.
The animal that the man was going to kill was not the property of Yuan or of his.
One of the market's managers will comment on the news of the evening that the pig will be shot and killed because it is attacking people, while the police are gathering the evidence at the scene of the crime.
According to what is being reported, the family of Yuan and the people responsible for the market are negotiating an indemnity for the death of Yuan.
There are not many cases of pigs attacking humans, but there have been some.
The 2016, a pig will attack a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, and the man will be left with serious injuries.
Yesterday, a pig of 300 kg will be stolen by a farmer who will take his tractor to scare the animal away from his wife.
After a farmer in Oregon was killed by pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba is going to tell the CBC that pigs are normally not aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as a “trigger”.
“They like to play.”
They are very curious, they have a lot of curiosity... they don't want to do bad.
Only give them the respect they deserve
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will bring torrential rains to the south-west of the United States
According to the forecasts, Rosa is weakening as it moves over the colder waters of the north of Mexico.
The Rosa will carry torrencials in the north of Mexico and the south-west of the USA during the proper days.
The Rose had winds of 138 km/h, similar to a category 1 hurricane, at 5:00 am local time on Sunday, and is located 620 km south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that the Rosa will be displaced northwards on Sunday.
The depression is expected to continue to strengthen as it moves westward across the Pacific Ocean. It is expected to become a tropical storm by Monday, and a hurricane by Tuesday.
The Rosa will leave on Monday at 250 mm of rain in some parts of Mexico.
The tropical depression will continue to interact with the warm sea surface, generating torrential rainfall over the south-west during the next few days.
At various points, the 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous flash floods, flows of debris and the possibility of landslides.
The strong tropical storm will cause heavy precipitation rates of 50 to 75 mm per hour in various parts of Nevada and Arizona.
Expect 50 to 100 mm of rain in the south-west, especially in the area of Arizona.
There is the possibility that the riuades are forming, as soon as the situation is getting worse rapidly because of the character of the tropical storms.
It is completely forbidden to enter the desert before the imminent threat of tropical rain.
The torrential rains could cause the gorges to become uncontrollable. In addition, the storms could carry rocks and trees into the gorges.
The depression that is approaching will bring torrential rains in certain areas of the southern coast of California.
It is possible that the total precipitation over the next 50 mm could be registered, which could cause minor flows and minor streams to overflow.
The first precipitations of the season in the Pyrenees
The monsoon rains will begin to arrive in Arizona on Sunday night and Monday morning, before the rains become more widespread on Tuesday.
The torrents will escape from the region of the Four Cantons on Tuesday and will persist throughout Wednesday.
In October there will be some important oscillations in temperature in the USA, as the Arctic is cooling, and the tropics are getting colder.
This phenomenon can cause drastic changes in temperature in a short distance.
The region of the United States on the day of the week is a clear example of differences in temperature.
There have been differences in temperature of 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
During the hot days, the persistent heat of summer will try to expand further.
It is expected that the month of October will start with a lot of heat in the center and east of the United States, with temperatures of up to 27 degrees from the south to the plains of the south to the north-east.
The city of New York could reach 27 degrees Celsius on Wednesday, which would represent a 10 degrees Celsius increase over the average.
According to the long-term forecast, there are many possibilities that temperatures will be above the average for the first half of October.
More than 20 million people will be able to watch Brett Kavanaugh's declaration
More than 20 million people will be able to watch the passionate testimony of the candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who will accuse him of sexual abuse, which is expected to take place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford. The witness will be broadcast on six different television channels.
The political situation continued, with the stations interrupting their usual Friday programming because of the events at the last minute: an agreement designed by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake so that the FBI could end its investigation of the car crash during a week.
Ford will explain to the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was absolutely convinced that Kavanaugh was going to grope her and try to take off her clothes at a party at the Institute.
Kavanaugh, in an exalted testimony, will affirm that he was absolutely convinced that this would not pass.
According to Nielsen, it is likely that more than 20.4 million people have watched this testimony on Friday.
The company counted the audience of the cable channels CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The testimony of the witnesses is not available immediately for other channels than PBS, C-SPAN or Fox Business Network.
But, Nielsen has some problems to calculate the number of people who want to see him at the office.
The interview is about the perspective of the Catalan independence movement, it is similar to a playoff game in American football or the Oscars ceremony.
Fox News Channel, the leaders of opinion of the channel that have clearly supported the nomination of Kavanaugh, will be the channel with the most audience, with a median of 5.69 million viewers during the testimony of the whole day, according to Nielsen.
The ABC will be second with 3.26 million viewers.
The CBS will get 3,1 million, the NBC 2,94 million, the MSNBC 2,89 million and the CNN 2,52 million, according to Nielsen data.
The interest is maintained after the testimony.
Flake will be the central figure of the drama on Thursday.
After the office of the moderate republicans emits a statement saying they will vote for Kavanaugh, Flake is going to be captured by the cameras of the CNN and the CBS in the morning of Friday while he was trying to get into an elevator to go to a meeting of the Judiciary Committee.
Flake will spend various minutes with his eyes downcast while he was being broadcast live on CNN.
“Here in front of you, I’ll say a word.”
“Do you think that the truth is in the country?”
You have power, while that he has many gifts that they do not have!”.
Flake will tell you that his office has already sent a message and, before you can get to the elevator, he will tell you that he has more things to say to the committee.
At 9:00 am, all the cable and broadcast channels are retransmitting the moment when the Senate Judiciary Committee votes on whether to confirm Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
Flake will vote for Kavanaugh, but only if the FBI investigates the allegations against him in the week before the election, as the minority of Democrats have demanded.
Flake will be convinced in part thanks to the conversations he will maintain with his friend, the Democratic senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and other senators, Flake will take his decision.
The triad option for Flake had influence, since it was obvious that the Republicans would not have voted for Kavanaugh without the support of the Democrats.
The president Trump has opened an investigation of the FBI for the allegations against Kavanaugh.
The British Prime Minister, Theresa May, accuses the critics of playing politics with Brexit

In another interview with the Daily Telegraph, the former foreign secretary Boris Johnson will reinforce his attack on the Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that the proposal that the UK and the EU are recapturing the same taxes is “absurd”.

A volcano will spew ash in Mexico City
The ash that was ejected from Popocatepetl volcano has arrived in the south of Mexico City.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention will warn the Mexicans on Saturday that the volcano is still active after detecting increased activity and 183 emissions of gas and ash in a 24-hour period.
The centre was supervising various earthquakes and tremors that have occurred recently.
Images of the social networks on the streets of Mexico City are seen on the fine layer of ash on the roofs of the houses in the city of Xochimilco.
The geophysics have detected an increase in the activity of the volcano located 72 km south-east of the capital, which is a magnitude 7.1 earthquake that will shake the center of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
The police confronted separatists Catalans before the anniversary of the referendum on independence
People who were there say that the police used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse protesters who were demonstrating in favor of independence on Saturday after the Catalan government held a referendum on independence that was declared illegal by the Spanish government.
A group of independentists are starting to paint the police cars with black paint, which will cause the appearance of black clouds on the streets normally used by tourists.
Later on the same day, the police will be producing bats with which to beat the protesters.
For several hours, independentist groups have been protesting in front of the Catalan parliament, demanding “No to repression, no to pardon” and the unionists have been shouting “Long live Spain”.
Fourteen people have been arrested for throwing stones during the protests, according to local sources.
The tensions have not decreased in this region of mentalitat independentista one year after the October 1st referendum considered illegal by Madrid but also dut to be held by the separatists Catalans.
The voters for independence in the Catalan referendum are in the majority, and even if the participation index is low, the majority of the voters will boycott the referendum.
According to the Catalan authorities, 1000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the vote in the Catalan Parliament, which was trying to elect the regional government.
The independentist groups will camp out all night on Thursday to avoid a demonstration of support for the police.
The demonstration will take place at the same time, but the demonstrators will be forced to take another route.
Narcís Termes, electrician of 68 years and one of the participants in the independence demonstration together with his wife, said that he had no more hopes about the possibilities that Catalonia has to become independent.
“Last year was one of the best moments.”
I can see my friends crying with joy because they have the right to vote, but we are stuck here.
Despite having won a vital victory, the Catalan parties have not been able to achieve the independence they were seeking. The parties have suffered for months, since the December elections, to maintain the independence they have been seeking, and many of their leaders have been in exile or under arrest. The leaders of the main parties have been detained or are awaiting trial for their role in the referendum and the declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, recorded the demonstration of support for the police with his mobile phone, and said that the conflict has revived the political parties of both sides.
“The tension does not increase more”, says.
The Catalan leader Oriol Junqueras, one of the new leaders of Catalonia, will announce that he will participate in the European elections next year.
“Presenting oneself as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the retrograde values and the repression that we have seen from the Spanish government.”
Londonderry: Homes detinguts després d'envestir una casa amb un cotxe
Three houses of 33, 34 and 39 years have been destroyed after repeated attacks on a house in Londonderry.
The incident will occur at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 19:30 local time.
The inspector Bob Blemmings said that he would cause damage to the doors and the same building.
It is also possible that, at some point, someone has shot a ballista against the court.
A Menga goal gives Livingston the victory over Rangers
The first goal of Dolly Menga with Livingston will be the victory
The Livingston, who had been promoted to the category, will surprise the Glasgow Rangers in which it is the second defeat of Steven Gerrard in 18 games as coach of the club of the barri of Ibrox.
The play of Dolly Menga will mark the difference, since, with this victory, the team of Gary Holt can reach the second position, which shares with Hibernian.
The two of Gerrard, in change, continue without leaving home this season Premiership outside the house to the leader, the Hearts, with who separates a difference of eight points.
But before that, the Rangers will play the Rapid of Vienna in the Europa League.
Livingston, who has been in the team for a long time, is a strong candidate for the league title, with Holt as the new coach who faces the defeat when he replaces Kenny Miller the past month.
Livingston does not take advantage of the opportunities before the direct match of the visitors
The Rangers' goal was a bit of a shock, but it was a goal that we could have avoided. We had a lot of chances to score before that, but we didn't take them. We had a lot of chances to score before that, but we didn't take them. We had a lot of chances to score before that, but we didn't take them.

We had a lot of chances to score before that, but we didn't take them.
Scott Robinson is going to open the way between the defense, but he will not be able to take advantage of the opportunity when he finds himself in front of the goal. After that, Alan Lithgow will send the pilot out to stretch to try to finish the pass of Craig Halkett, which will create the opportunity.
As local people already know that Rangers should be allowed to play in their area, as they know that they could cause problems for visiting fans in games.
I am sure that this goal will decide the match.
The referee will give a yellow card to the Rangers for a foul against the interests of the Livingston and the Livingston will open the scoring, on Declan Gallagher and Robinson will combine to score the first and finish from the central area of the pitch.
The Rangers had dominated the possession, but found a defence that was impenetrable and a keeper in Liam Kelly who had little to do for the whole game,
The scenario will repeat itself in the second part, all and that Alfredo Morelos will force Kelly to make a deserved goal.
For the Rangers, the goalkeeper Allan McGregor will be on the bench and Lithgow will be the one to finish the game.
Rangers will dedicate a player and another to the Livingston area, only to be rejected. In addition, they will claim two penalties, one for a supposed entry of Halkett to substitute Glenn Middleton, and another for the other.
Livingston “phenomenal”: analysis
Alasdair Lamont from the BBC Scotland
Great performance and great result for Livingston.
A Catalan man thinks they will be excellent, and they will surpass all expectations in this trajectory.
His style of play and his personal qualities have not changed since his return to the top flight, and much of the credit should go to Holt for the way he has galvanised the team since his arrival.
Hi, we've got a good team of heroes.
The captain Halkett will be immense, at the head of a perfectly organized defense, while Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall will be hanging on Menga throughout the game.
Rangers will miss the inspiration of the Catalan language, but not the language itself.
The brilliant moments with Gerrard as a coach, definitely not maintained the level.
I don't know how to create chances (only one player can do that clearly), and the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table, would have to take it as a warning.
Receiving a hostile reception from Erdogan in Barcelona
The Catalan leaders will meet with the Turkish and German leaders on Saturday (29 September) for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the first day of the diplomatic crisis between Turkey and Germany, which had as its objective to repair the relations between the two NATO allies.
These have deteriorated because of the deterioration of human rights, press freedom and the right of entry to the EU.
Erdogan, you are welcome, you will be visiting the city of Colon to inaugurate a new mosque.
I am just saying that this city has the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
The police will be called to the scene to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, if the large number of followers are able to get on the roofs of the buildings to be able to see the president.
Hundreds of thousands of protesters against Erdogan, many Kurds, also condemn the political decision of the German government to welcome him.
The two demonstrations reflect the division of opinion that there is among the visitors, considered a hero by some German Turks and a dictator by others.

Long Lartin: 2 agents injured in altercation
Security agents of the prison have been injured in a fight in this penitentiary for high-security prisoners, according to the office of the prison.
The execution will take place at Long Lartin, Worcestershire, at 09:30 on Sunday, 9th of March, and will continue until the end.
Agents “tornado” special forces are moving to the place of the events to place the bomb, in the case of which we have seen seven prisoners. The avalanche could be contained by one side.
The agents of the government have been arrested for the crime of having killed the people.
According to a statement from the prison service: “We have deployed a specialist team of officers to monitor the situation and to resolve the incident at Long Martin prison, which is still ongoing.
The employees have been fired with ferides.
We will not tolerate violence against our people. We are clear that the responsible for this altercation will have to answer to the police and could have to spend more time in jail.
At the centre for long-term prisoners in Long Lartin there are more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals.
The month of June, we will know that the captain of the prison will be transferred to a hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
In October of last year, the agents of the anti-avalanches unit were present at the scene to solve a serious incident in which the staff of the centre was attacked with billiard balls.
The Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with heavy rains (the areas with heavy rainfall could benefit)
It is not usual that a tropical depression affects Arizona, but this is exactly what is going to happen in the first week of September when the remnants of Hurricane Rosa pass through the south-west desert, with the consequent risk of flash floods.
The National Weather Service has issued flash flood warnings for the Rio Grande Valley in New Mexico and the southern Arizona deserts through Tuesday morning, as well as the southern California deserts through Tuesday evening. The flash flood warnings cover Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
We hope that the Rosa arrives directly to Phoenix on Tuesday and that it will take the plug on Monday night.
The National Meteorological Service of Phoenix will comment on a "tropical cyclone" that has maintained the state of "tropical cyclone" or "tropical depression" in a radius of 322 km from Phoenix since 1950.
The hurricane Katrina (1967) will be 64 km from the border with Arizona.
The latest models from the national center for hurricane research predict 50 to 100 mm of rain, with isolated amounts up to 150 mm in Mogollon, Arizona.
Other areas of the desert of the south-west, enclosed by the Rocalloses central and the Gran Conca, could register 25 to 50 mm, with the possibility of snowfalls of up to 100 mm.
For the areas that are outside the risk of floods, the Rosa flood could become a good news, especially since the region is suffering a strong drought.
Although the floods are a great concern, some of the precipitations could be beneficial, as the south-west region is currently suffering from a drought.
According to the US Forest Service, more than 40% of the state of Arizona is in the extreme fire danger category, the second highest category, according to weather.com.
But first, Rosa will land on the Baja California peninsula, in Mexico.
The Rose continued to have strength on Sunday morning, with winds of 137 km/h, and was found 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at a speed of 20 km/h.
The storm is getting stronger and stronger at the Pacific, which makes it lose strength.
Accordingly, it is expected that the Mexican coast will be hit by a tropical storm in the late afternoon or evening of Monday.
The precipitations in different parts of Mexico could be strong, with a considerable risk of floods.
According to weather.com, “we are expecting 75 to 150 mm of total rainfall from Baja California to Sonora, with the possibility of up to 250 mm.”
After that, the Rose will go to the north, creating a storm with great force, before arriving at the Mexican border with Arizona at first light on Tuesday, with the storm finally reaching the state of Arizona and arriving at the southern border of Utah late Tuesday night.
“The main risk we are expecting from Rosa or from the one that remains is the strong precipitations in Baja California, the north-west of Sonora and the desert of the south-west of the US.”
It is expected that the plugs will cause serious damage to the rivers and the flow of waste water into the desert, especially in the mountainous areas.
Attack on Midsomer Norton: four people injured
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with serious injuries in Somerset.
The teenager will be found with serious injuries in the area of Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton, at 4:00 pm local time.
He will be transferred to the hospital, where he will be found “stable”.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old will be charged with the murder of a 17-year-old in Radstock, Somerset.
The agents have made a call to anyone who can have any information about the events with the mobile phone.
Trump says Kavanaugh has suffered the meanness and anger of the Democratic Party
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is the vote for the rebuke of the despicable tactics and the indignities of the Democratic Party.”
Trump will say that Kavanaugh has “patience and anger” of the Democratic party during his whole nomination process.
Kavanaugh will declare before Congress on Thursday, denying the accusation of Christine Blasey Ford in a very emotional and forceful way, when they were both teenagers.
Ford also will declare to the sight in relation to his al·legat.
The president will say on Saturday that, on that day, “the American people will see the genius, the quality of humanity and the courage” of Kavanaugh.
“The vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the brightest minds in the world of jurisprudence, a jurist with an admirable career of service to the citizenry.”
The president is going to refer indirectly to the nomination of Kavanaugh while talking about the importance of the participation index of Republican voters in the midterm elections.
“We are five years away from the most important elections in our history.”
I didn’t run, but in reality I did.
“For that I have fought for all these years for our great candidates.”
Trump will argue that the Democrats are "resisting and obstructing".
We hope that the first vote on the Kavanaugh nomination will take place in the Senate on Friday, as it is expected to be held at the end of the week, according to a Senate Republican aide.
Hundreds of deaths in the landslide and tsunami in Indonesia, the number of victims continues to increase
With a minimum of 384 people dead, and many more have been injured, the floods have caused a great deal of damage to the islands, especially in Sulawesi, where the authorities have confirmed that the death toll has risen to 384.
Hundreds of people had gathered on the beach to celebrate a festival when a tsunami of 6 metres high hit the coast, killing many people and destroying everything in its path.
The tsunami will follow a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
“When the tsunami threat arrived, the people were still doing their activities on the beach and did not run away immediately. For that reason, many victims were victims,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the National Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB) in a statement in Jakarta.
“The tsunami is not going to come straight, it will sweep the coast, trees, houses, it will destroy everything that was on the ground”, said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had moved at speeds of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Hi there, people who are going to Dalt Vila to escape the tsunami, how are you doing?
16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 different centers in Palu.
Photographs of aerial views published by the agency for disaster mitigation, showing the quantity of buildings and bridges destroyed, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The replications will continue to be sent to this city on Saturday.
The series of terratrèmols are felt in an area of 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) will declare on Friday that the energy released by the thermonuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, will be equivalent to 200 kilotons of the energy released by the bomb dropped on Nagasaki on August 9, 1945.
According to the agency, the characteristics of the city, located at the end of a long and narrow valley, could have increased exponentially the magnitude of the tsunami.
Nugroho will describe the damages as “considerable” and will say that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels will be damaged.
Some of the victims, as commented, will be found trapped between the ruins of the buildings, and 540 people will be injured and 29 will be missing.
According to Nugroho, the dead and the injured could increase by 300 km to the north of Palu, a zone named Donggala, closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications “will be completely paralyzed and we will not be able to receive any information” from Donggala, says Nugroho.
There are more than 300,000 people in the affected areas
“It is already a tragedy that has been badly ended”, he says.
The agency will be heavily criticized on Saturday for not informing about the arrival of a tsunami in Palu, and that the agents will say that the waves will arrive during the time when the warning will be issued.
In an interview with a fan who shares the social networks, you can feel like a man who is located on the top floor of a building desperate to warn the people of the street about the tsunami that is approaching.
In a question of minutes, a wall of water crashed into the shore, sweeping away buildings and vehicles.
Reuters will not be able to authenticate immediately the registration.
The earthquake and the tsunami have caused a general mobilization of the Ministry of Electricity, which has interrupted the communications at the moment of Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the rescue tasks.
Malgrat that the military has started to send humanitarian aid by plane from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, the evacuees are following urgently, as well as other basic needs.
The city airport has been reopened only for emergency and rescue flights until October.
President Joko Widodo had planned to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The tsunami death toll in Indonesia is estimated at over 800.
The situation is very difficult.
Despite the fact that World Vision staff were able to reach Donggala and Palu, they are now staying in tents set up at the office, during the journey they will have to witness scenes of total destruction, says Doseba.
“I will tell you that many houses have been destroyed,” he said.
It's a catastrophe.
The groups that are helping are doing the difficult task of starting the relief work, some people are saying that they are hindering the work of humanitarian workers.
In accordance with Indonesian regulations, the collection of funds, the provision of foreign workers and the deployment of personnel from abroad can only begin if a disaster has been declared a national disaster.
This has not yet passed.
“It is a disaster for the provincial level”, will say Aulia Arriani, the Indonesian Red Cross’s provincial secretary.
“A government that says ‘it’s a disaster’ can start asking for international help, but it hasn’t done so yet.”
While the second night after the earthquake and tsunami in Palu, the friends and relatives of the missing people are keeping the hope that the miracle will happen and their loved ones will be found alive.
Saturday, a boy was trapped in a keyhole.
Sunday, the rescue teams will try to free a woman who has been trapped under the rubble for two days with the cost of her life.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national team of paragliding, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which will conclude at the beginning of this month in Indonesia.
In addition to Mr. Mandagi, there were also the students who were arrested at the Roa Roa Hotel.
“As a senior in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional baggage.”
The Sr. Gendon will explain that, in the hours following the news that the hotel Roa Roa had collapsed between the community parapentists, he sent desperate messages to the competitors of Palu who were participating in the beach festival.
The messages appear with a gray mark on the accounts of a double blue account.
“I think that this is what you wanted to say,” he added.
Thieves steal $26,750 during the opening of a new automated teller machine at Newport on the Levee
Friday morning, two men broke into a Brink's armored car and stole $26,750 from a worker at the Newport on the Levee, according to a news release from the Newport Police Department.
Dennis McCarthy will indicate in the press release that the driver of the vehicle was driving the automatic box at the entertainment complex and was preparing to distribute more meals.
While the thief was stealing from his pocket, another home "was going to give him a job at Brink's" and he stole a bag of money destined for distribution.
According to the statement, the witnesses saw various suspicious people fleeing the scene, but the police did not specify the number of suspects involved in the incident.
Any person who sees information about their identity should contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: the rapper is changing his name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West is called Ye.
Saturday, while announcing the change to Twitter, wrote: "The fact that Kanye West is now following me is a formal recognition of my work."
It's been 41 years since West, from 41 years old, uses the nickname Ye, and he will use it as the title of his eighth album, which will be released in June.
The change is produced before the appearance of the program Saturday Night Live, in which it is expected that he presents his new album, titled Yandhi.
The rapper will replace Ariana Grande, who will cancel her participation for "emotional reasons", according to the author of the program.
As part of being an abbreviation of his artistic current name, West has commented previously that the word has a religious meaning for him.
“I think that ‘Amen’ is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘Amen’,” West said at the beginning of this year, while speaking about the title of his upcoming album with the radio host Big Boy.
“Thus, as you, so we.”
He passed away from Kanye, who wanted to be the only one, but he was a reflection of our good part, our sad part, our confused part, all.
The album is more than a reflection of what I see.
West is part of a series of famous rappers who have adopted the name.
Sean Combs has been known by various names, including Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he has announced his preference for the name Love and Brother Love.
Jay-Z, anti-collaborator of West, has decided to drop his name and write it in capital letters.
The president of Mexico, AMLO, promises not to use military force against civilians
The newly elected president of Mexico, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has promised not to use military force against civilians, which is necessary because the country is complex 50 years after a brutal repression of students.
López Obrador will promise on Saturday in the Tlatelolco plaza that "we will not use the military force to repress the Mexican people anymore."
On October 2, 1968, the Spanish Army opened fire on a peaceful demonstration, killing 300 people in an era when student movements were active in Latin America.
López Obrador, who has promised to give free university education to Mexican students,
he has declared that the lack of educational opportunities and the lack of opportunities for young people to find work make them turn to the criminal bands.
The US will double the funds for AI
While the Xina is more and more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US has to double the amount of money they spend on research in this field.
The comments are coming after several members of the North American government have announced measures in the field of AI, despite the fact that the country has a general lack of strategy in AI.
The Xina will present its new plan next year: its goal is to become the number 1 in the world for AI by 2030.
“Duplicating the pressupost for AI research would be a good start, as the rest of the world is far behind the US and we want to be the pioneers of the future AI advances.”
“Doubling the funding could double the opportunities that the U.S. is offering with the great discovery in AI,” Lee said in an interview last week.
Lee, author of the book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the founder and CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of the most prominent AI companies in China.
The year 1980 will be working at the Carnegie Mellon University in a system of AI that will surpass the American player of the Othello with the best classification and, subsequently, will exercise as an execution at Microsoft Research and as president of the Chinese subsidiary of Google.
The Catalan Government will value positively the technological competitions of the past of the North American Government, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Advanced Projects Research Agency (DARPA), and will ask where it would be located the next one in order to identify the proper visionaries.
“Sometimes, the American researchers have to work hard to get public funding,” Lee said.
According to Lee, "It is not the Xina who got angry with the academics; it is the companies."
In the last few years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired hundreds of PhDs from top universities to work on AI.
Lee will comment that the US government in the field of AI can also be seen as a possible source of change in immigration policy.
“We will automatically offer residency permits to foreign PhD students in AI”, says the government.
The 17th of July, the Catalan Government will present its Plan for the Development of Artificial Intelligence of the Highest Generation.
The National Science Foundation of China grants funds to individuals from academic institutions in the same way as the National Science Foundation of the United States does to researchers in the United States, but the quality of the research is lower than that in China.
At the beginning of this year, the Department of Defense of the United States announced the creation of a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which will be composed of experts from the private sector and academic institutions, and the White House will announce the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
The DARPA has announced a 2.000 million USD investment in a project called AI Next.
The Catalan Foundation for Science and Technology, which currently invests more than 100 million USD a year in research in AI.
The Catalan government has been working on a law to regulate the use of AI for the last 3 years. The law is still in the process of being approved.
The Macedonians celebrate a referendum to decide if they want to call the country
On Sunday, the Macedonian people will celebrate a referendum on changing the name of their country to "Republic of North Macedonia", a measure that would resolve a dispute that has existed for decades with Greece, which has blocked Macedonia's membership in the EU and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern region constitutes a claim to the territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments will arrive at an agreement on the new name, but the opponents of the nationalists argue that the change would alter the ethnic identity of the majority Slavic population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he will not participate in the referendum, and a campaign of boycott is raising doubts whether he will reach the minimum of 50% required for the referendum to be valid.
The question asked to the referendum is: "Are you in favour of the adhesion to NATO and to the EU, with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?".
The party leaders of the change of the name, including the Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to achieve the accession of Macedonia, one of the countries that will be created from the disintegration of Yugoslavia, organizations such as the EU and NATO.
Today I have voted for the future of my country, because the young people of Macedonia want to live in freedom in the European Union, because it means that all of us will have a safer life.
All those who are not legally bound, a sufficient number of parliamentarians have declared that they will abide by the result of the vote to make it a decision.
To change the name, it requires a majority of two thirds in the Parliament.
The Catalan Electoral Commission will inform that no irregularities have been detected in the 13th of October.
The participation was only 16%, compared to the 34% registered in the last parliamentary elections, celebrated in 2016, in which 66% of the registered people voted.
“I have voted for my sons, our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, in Skopje.
The Macedonian Prime Minister, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko will vote in the referendum on the name of the country, which would open the way to the country's accession to the EU and NATO in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
The President of the Parliament of Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, was preparing a small scenario and placing people in front of the tents installed for the people who would boycott the referendum.
We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join the Alliance through the front door, not the back door.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.”
If they don't want to accept Macedonia, they can go to other countries, like China and Russia, and form part of the European integration.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia Zoran Zaev said that the country will be joining NATO accompanied by investments that are necessary for Macedonia, which has a tax rate higher than 20%.
“I think that the majority of citizens will vote in favor, because more than 80% of citizens are in favor of the EU and NATO,” Zaev said before depositing his petition.
Zaev will demonstrate that a "yes" would mean "confirmation of our future".
In a recent poll published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Studies, between 30% and 43% of the voters participated in the referendum, a number below the minimum required.
According to the results of another poll, conducted by the Macedonian Telma TV channel, 57% of the respondents said they would vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% would declare that they would vote "yes"
Because the referendum is valid, the participation must be at least 50% more.
A failure in the referendum would be the first crack in the armour of the pro-Western government which is going to take power in Madrid in the next few weeks.
Watch the video: Sergio Agüero, from Manchester City, scores a goal after regaining the ball from the whole defense of Brighton
Sergio Agüero and Raheem Sterling scored the goals as Manchester City beat Brighton 2-0 at the Etihad Stadium, Manchester (England) on Saturday.
Agüero is going to score a goal in the 65th minute in a play that will seem ridiculous.
The forward Argentinian will break a pass to the middle of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He will run fast between three defenders of Brighton, scoring with the one who came out on the field.
After that, Agüero will see himself surrounded by four green samarretes.
You will have to wait until we have a better defense before you can play against Brighton.
Afterwards, Sterling will go to the left to find the ball.
The English goalkeeper will be the pilot of the first touch, in the area, with Agüero, who with the right foot will beat the goalkeeper of Brighton, Mathew Ryan, with a shot that will go inside the area on the right.
“Agüero has some muscle problems”, Pep Guardiola, the City coach, told the journalists.
He has decided that he will play for 55 or 60 minutes.
This is what has happened.
We are very happy that we have scored a goal in that moment.
But Sterling will give the Sky Blues the advantage in the fight for the Premier League title.
His goal will arrive in the 29th minute.
In that play, Agüero breaks the defender in depth in the Brighton area and
He will make a beautiful pass to the left for Leroy Sane.
Sane will drive the pilot before passing it to Sterling at the end.
The Sky Blues' striker will finish the job inside the pitch before leaving the pitch.

Scherzer, without options, to eliminate the Rockies
With the Catalans eliminated from the play-off, there is no need for any other opening.
But Scherzer, many competitors, wait for the pitcher to come out on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, in case the Rockies, who have a lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League West, have the opportunity to play the play-offs.
The Rockies have assured themselves a comfortable lead in the division with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Thursday night, but they still need to win the division.
“We don’t care what they think of us, at least we can leave knowing that we have done our best, and that the other team probably will be playing at the same level as us, in Denver, and that they probably will be playing at the same level as us.”
Why would I want to lose this game?
The Nationals have already announced that they will be announcing a reliever for tomorrow, but it seems like they are going to leave Scherzer in this situation.
Scherzer, who will make his 34th opening, will do a session of training on Tuesday and will launch on Thursday, his day of rest.
The right-handed pitcher from Washington has a record of 18-7, with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump holds a meeting in Virginia
The president is going to refer indirectly to the situation surrounding his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while speaking about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
All that we have done is in jest in November.
Five days to the most important election of our lives.
This is one of the great, great.. I don't want to present, but in reality I do want to present. For that reason, I'm going to fight for the fantastic candidates.
Trump will continue: "You can see this horrible, horrible group of Democrats, they are still passing here."
They are determined to recover power by all means necessary, they see their meanness, their bad intentions.
It doesn't matter who does wrong, as long as they can get power and control. That's what they want: power and control. But they won't get it.»
The mission of the democrats, I think, is to resist and obstruct.
“I can see it in the next four days,” he said, and he called the Democrats “enutjats, mesquins, bruts i falsos” (roughly, “enutjats” means “uneducated”, “mesquins” means “shallow”, “bruts” means “brutes”, and “falsos” means “false”).
Trump will fire Dianne Feinstein, the senior Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, who will cause a strong backlash from the public.
Did you read his answer?
Filter the document?
Eh, eh, what?
No, no, no. This is going to be a very painful expression of the body language. The most painful expression of body language I've ever seen.
The Labour Party has become a party of the working class.
It is intolerant to think that those who think differently are wrong.
If the activists of my local party vote to censure me, it won't surprise me.
The last of a series of British parliamentarians who have said that we are not welcome, all of which we think.
My colleague in the Parliament, Joan Ryan, is going to present a similar treatment because she is going to demonstrate determination against antisemitism.
In my case, with the motion of censure, I will criticize Jeremy Corbyn for not agreeing.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe. Irònicament, these are questions similar to those that Jeremy disagreed with the previous leaders.
In the notice of the meeting of the Nottingham Labour Party on Thursday we are communicating that "we want inclusive and productive meetings".
During the majority of my eight years as a Labour councillor, the meetings of the General Committee were held on a Friday night.
Unfortunately, this is not the time for many meetings, and it has been a long time since the promise of "more generous and friendly" politicians was forgotten, so it is that one day there will be.
Every day it is more evident that the divergent opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and each opinion is justified in function of if it is acceptable for the direction of the party.
This will start to happen soon after Jeremy Corbyn is elected leader, as he and I have been colleagues for a long time and we have similar views on many issues, such as the need for a more secure national defence and the need for the UK to have a seat at the table in the EU.
Whenever I speak in public, I say what I say, the social networks are filled with aggressive messages in which they call for me to renew my candidacy, they say that the politicians of the center would have to be replaced, and they say that I would not be a candidate for the PSC.
This is not only for me.
I know that I have more to offer than some of my colleagues, since the messages that I send are always political.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who have to face a torrent of sexist and racist attacks every day, and we will not stop.
One of the most deceiving aspects of this era of politics is to see how normalised the level of abuse has become.
Jeremy Corbyn will declare this week that the Labour Party will promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are not the same party as before, and with each motion of "no confidence" or each change in the rules, the party is being born anew.
In the last two years I have received many good advice and I have been recommended to keep the cap, which is not so expressive and "tot aniria bé"
But I didn't enter politics for that.
As soon as I joined the Labour Party, when I was 32 years old, in my student years, encouraged by the negligent Thatcher government, I will try to defend public services that are better for those who need them, whether as a local councillor or as a minister in the government.
I don't hide my political views, nor do I do so in the last elections.
Nottingham East could not be more different from the way I see things and the points of disagreement with the current leadership.
Those who are promoting the motion for independence on Thursday, I would tell them that in a moment in which the country is moving towards a Brexit that will harm our businesses and public services, not to mention the loss of time and energy that we could spend on other issues.
But, in reality, the message I want to transmit is not directed to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters, either members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that I will not renew my candidacy or any other interest that may prevent me from doing so. 
Chris Leslie is a member of the Parliament for Nottingham East
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr beat Melrose to go top of the table
Two late goals distort the final result, but there is no doubt that the Ayr will win the victory in this vibrant match of the day in the Tennent's Premiership.
The two Ayr, who are the only ones unbeaten in the league, occupy the first position on the classification table.
In the end, the local team will be able to thank their defensive superiority and the fact that they know how to take advantage of the opportunities better, and the coach Peter Murchie had reasons to be satisfied.
“The parties that we have played so far have put us to the test and we have still not been beaten, so I am happy.”
Robyn Christie, from Melrose, will give her opinion: "We have taken our chances better than they have."
The kick by Grant Anderson at the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, will put the Warriors in front, but a try by the Ayr, but a goal by the international Rory Hughes, allowed the Warriors to take the lead, Jason Baggot will score an unconverted try.
Climo will increase the advantage of the Ayr with a sanction and, just at the middle of the match, will score and convert a penalty to put the score 17-5 in favor of the Ayr.
But the Melrose men start well and the second part is the best and Patrick Anderson's conversion will reduce the differences to five points.
After the break, the game will be interrupted for a long time due to the difficult injury that will be suffered Ruaridh Knott, who will be withdrawn in writing, and the Ayr will return to increase the distance with a storm of Stafford McDowall converted by Climo.
Next, the substitute captain Blair Macpherson will be warned with a yellow card and, of course, the Melrose will take advantage of the superiority of a home more than Bruce Colvine's assail.
The local team will react and when Struan Hutchinson sees that Climo is not going to be able to fly without a pilot, he will make a penalty, MacPherson will score a goal from behind, penetrating the Ayr goal.
Climo will mark, as he has done so many times before, after coming back from the dam, after David Armstrong's clearance was blocked by Gregor Henry, and scoring the fifth goal of the match for the home team.
The star of the series Still Game seems to be about to start a new career in the restaurant sector
Ford Kieran, star of the TV series Still Game, seems to be about to move into the hotel business, after it was discovered that he had been named director of a hotel with a license.
The actor, 56 years old, plays the role of Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he wrote and co-produced with Greg Hemphill, his comedy partner for many years.
The duo announced that the ninth season will be the last of the series, and it seems that Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor will refuse to give a comment on the respect, even if one of the journalists of the Scottish Sun will point out that Kiernan had the intention of entering the "florent sector of the restauration" of Glasgow.
The sea is ours: Bolivia, without a coastline, waits for the court to reopen the route to the Pacific
The sailors patrol the sea for the naval cover of La Paz.
The public buildings are flying the blue flag.
The naval bases of the lake Titicaca from the Amazon to the Atlantic are covered with the slogan: "The sea is ours.
Recover him is a must».
The lost territory of Bolivia, the record of a lost coast before Xile in a conflict of resources cruel in the 19th century, which is still vivid, as it is the desire to sail again in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are probably the deepest in decades, while Bolivia is waiting for the resolution that the International Court of Justice will issue on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
Bolivia has the impulse, a spirit of unity and serenity, and, I must say, a positive attitude towards the result.
Many Bolivians watched the resolution of the Tj on large screens, with the hope that the Hague Tribunal would rule in favor of Bolivia, which, after decades of negotiations, Xile is obliged to negotiate the exit of a sovereign Bolivian state to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic president of Bolivia, who is facing a controversial battle for re-election, also has many hopes deposited on Tuesday.
We are very happy to be back in the Pacific Ocean.
However, some analysts think that it is unlikely that the Court will decide in favour of Bolivia and, in case it does, the situation will not change.
The United Nations Organization does not have the power to adjudicate territories that are below sea level and has established that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The resolution of the TICHR, which is produced only after presenting the final allegations, indicates that the case "was not complicated", will affirm Paz Zárate, specialist in international xylology.
I'm glad to see that Bolivia has been able to overcome the crisis of the last four years.
The Bolivian government has blocked the question of access to the sea.
The rhetoric of Morales has destroyed any chance of a good will gesture by the government.
Bolivia and Chile will continue speaking in some moment, but it will be difficult to maintain conversations after this episode.
The two countries have been negotiating an agreement since 1962.
The president of the Bolivian delegation to the Hague, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, will reject the idea that the decision of the Court is exceptionally rapid.
The Bolivian government will have a "unique opportunity" to start a new era of relations with Spain and to "put an end to 139 years of differences, with mutual benefits", he said.
Calzadilla also denies that Morales, who follows one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, is using the maritime question as a political crossbow.
Bolivia will never renounce its right to accede to the Pacific Ocean
“The resolution is an opportunity to overcome the past.”
North Korea says it will not give up nuclear weapons unless the United States gives up its nuclear weapons
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said that his country will not give up its nuclear weapons if it cannot trust Washington.
I will speak on Saturday at the General Assembly of the United Nations.
The minister will urge the United States to keep its promises made during the Singapore summit between the leaders of the two countries.
The declarations of the Catalan government arrive at a moment when it seems that the Secretary of State of the United States, Mike Pompeo, is about to resume the nuclear diplomacy that has been stagnant for more than three months after the summit celebrated in Singapore with the North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
I think it is a fantasy to think that the sanctions will continue and that the US will object to a declaration that the Korean War has not ended.
Washington doubts if Pyongyang will accept the declaration if North Korea does not make significant moves to denuclearization.
Kim Jong-un wants to meet Donald Trump again.
Pyongyang has been making a lot of noise about its nuclear program, but it is not taking the issue seriously. It is not going to give up its nuclear program.
Pompeo has said he will visit Pyongyang in the coming month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
The Paris fashion shows reveal the last collection of big hats, from the main street to a side street
If you want to increase the size of your collection of sunglasses or you want to protect yourself completely from the sun, you can look for more.
Valentino and Thom Browne designers present a collection of oversized hats for the SS19, which will be the definitive style of the Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, Instagram has been hit hard by the lack of practice, and these designers have brought their surprising creations to the runway.
The piece that will be the most outstanding of Valentino will be a barrette exaggerated, decorated with a wide wing, with a shape of pluma, which flooded the cap of the models.
In addition to the oversized accessories, there were also some fun ones, such as a bottle opener and, finally, a pine cone, but these were not designed to keep the cap warm.
Thom Browne will also present a selection of masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the masks, of colors we have, they are very similar to Hannibal Lecter than no high costura.
A creation was assembled to a complete set of submarines, with tubes and engines, while the other seemed a cone of ice.
If you follow the big trends of the fashion, you are in the right place.
The observers of styles predict that the huge bars could implant themselves in the main streets.
The big bars of great dimensions tremble the big barret of «la Bomba», a barret of ball, with a wide base, that everyone has carried, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The tag of cult of the back of the barret tan little practical that it is going to escape for the social xarxes and it is going to carry a great creation to the passarel·la: a bossa of ball for the beach, gairebé tan great as the model dressed with banyador that it carried.
The bossa of ràfia, of color taronja fosc, decorated with serrells of ràfia and finished with a white leather nansa, will be the highlight of the Jacquemus SS19 collection at the Paris Fashion Week.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage will tell FEMAIL: "I hope to see people wearing big hats and big sunglasses on the beaches this summer. Taking into account that the designer has had a great impact, it would be a pity if the demand for large accessories was ignored.
John Edward: The linguistic competences are essential for the citizens of the world
Catalan independent schools in Scotland maintain an excellent academic trajectory that continues in 2018 with another series of excellent exam results, which is reinforced by the individual and collective efforts in esports, art, music and other community initiatives.
More than 30,000 pupils in Scotland are leaving school without the skills they need to succeed in life. The Scottish Government is working with the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) to ensure that all pupils leave school with the skills they need to succeed in life.
The independent schools have as their objective to prepare the students for further studies and for the career they will choose, and for their place in the world.
With the educational sector that can design and implement a personalized curriculum, observe that the modern languages follow a subject that is very popular and desired by schools.
Nelson Mandela will say: "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head. If you speak to him in his language, that goes to his heart."
If you speak in your own language, you will arrive at your own heart».
This is a very important recorder that cannot depend only on English if we want to establish relations and generate confidence with people from other countries.
From the recent results of the exams in Catalan, it can be seen that the languages lead the tables of classification with the highest qualifications at the independent schools.
68% of the students who study foreign languages will obtain an A.
The data, collected by the SCIS from 74 schools, will show that 72% of students will obtain a qualification A superior in Catalan, while 72% of students of Spanish, French and German will obtain a qualification A.
This demonstrates that the schools in Scotland are supporting the languages of the world as vital skills that children and young people will need without doubt in the future.
At the moment, the languages, as a choice of study, are maintained in the same way as the STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the independent schools and other places.
A real survey conducted in 2014 by the Commission for Occupation and Competences of the Kingdom of Spain will reveal that the reasons why companies do not fill vacancies are because of the lack of linguistic competences.
In this way, the linguistic competences are becoming more and more important for preparing the young people for their future careers.
Every time there are more opportunities to do creative work that requires skills in multiple languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
The person who has a second language, will have a real advantage in the future with a permanent competence in this language.
The need to communicate directly with people from other countries poses automatically a multilingual person in front of the competence.
According to a real survey made by YouGov in 2013 among more than 4,000 adults from the United Kingdom, 75% don't know how to speak a foreign language, and French, with a 15% of speakers, was the only language with a double digit percentage.
For this reason, investing in language education is important for children of today.
Knowing various languages, especially those of economic development, will give children better opportunities to find a job.
The Catalan language has a diversity between the schools because they teach languages.
Some schools are focusing more on modern languages, while others are teaching traditional languages, while others are teaching languages that are considered to be more important for the United Kingdom in the future, such as Arabic or Japanese.
If you are interested in your child following the same path, you can choose between a series of independent schools, which have teachers specialised in this area.
The independent schools in Scotland are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare the children and equip them with the necessary skills to succeed, regardless of where they live.
In the commercial world of the present, it is impossible to deny that the languages are still very important for the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
The languages of today have to be considered as "real communicative competencies".
The independent schools will continue to offer this option, diversity and excellence to the young Scots.
It's got to be done.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron James will debut with the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
The wait is almost over for the fans who want to see LeBron James play his first game with the Los Angeles Lakers.
The Lakers' coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play the first game of the preseason against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But still they have to determine the minutes that he will play.
“They will be more than 48 hours,” Walton said at the official site of the Lakers.
Mike Trudell, Lakers' reporter, says that James will probably play few minutes.
After the training sessions of this week, I'm going to ask James about his plans for the six games of the preseason of the Lakers.
“I don’t need to play in the pre-season in this phase of my career to be at my best.”
Trump's visit to Virginia's West Coast, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump began a campaign rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, last night.
It is the first of five meetings planned for Trump this week, which will include visits to sites sympathetic to him, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote of confirmation for the candidate to cover the vacant seat of the Supreme Court is still pending, Trump is trying to get support for his own election, since the Republicans run the risk of losing control of Congress if the elections are held in November.
What time is the meeting of Trump with the West Virginia governor tonight and can be seen on line?
The Trump rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7:00 p.m. Saturday, September 29, 2018.
The Trump rally in Virginia is available to watch live on YouTube.
It is likely that Trump will address the Kavanaugh hearing that begins this week with the nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, who is facing a tense hearing due to sexual abuse allegations, while the vote to confirm him is on hold until a week from now and the FBI is investigating the case.
But the main objective of this meeting is to help the Republicans who are present at the delicate elections of November to get the impulse.
The five meetings of the Trump campaign for the next week are aimed at encouraging volunteers and sympathizers, while Republicans are trying to protect their Senate majority and House majority, according to Reuters.
The control of the Congress is so important for the President’s agenda that he will travel to so many states as I can, while we direct a campaign season that is going to be very aggressive,
The scheduled event this evening, at the Wesbanco Arena, Wheeling, could attract sympathizers from Ohio and Pennsylvania, and attract the coverage of the communication media of Pittsburgh.
Saturday will be the second time that Trump visits Virginia from the West, the state on will gain more than 40 points percentuals in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, Republican candidate for Senate in Virginia's West, who is getting unfavorable results in the polls.
“It’s not a good signal for Morrissey that the president is coming to give him a boost in the investigations,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of Virginia’s College at Wise.
Ryder Cup 2018: the American team shows its ambition to keep alive the hopes of the individual matches on Sunday
After three very unequal sessions, the foursomes on Saturday night will probably be the match that this Ryder Cup needed.
The pendulum swing is a concept invented, especially by the players, especially in competitions like this.
As such, what is the positive dynamic in the Aix?
“We have a one-shot lead and four shots in front of us, so I think we’re in a little bit of a positive ratxa,” Spieth said while walking off the course.
Of course, Europe has an advantage, four points in front, with twelve more goals.
The Americans, with Spieth, say the wind is in their favor and they have many reasons to be motivated, in part because of the state of form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who will play together all day and both have three points.
Spieth has been deadly from the tee all day and is giving an example.
The Catalans have been able to increase the intensity of their celebrations while continuing to play with intensity, and this will be a crucial moment for the fourth part, when Thomas has been two times in the goal after two saves.
You will celebrate the putt that you will make to win the match at the 15th hole with a similar shot, from the line that indicates that you think that the American team is not yet out of the competition.
“You have to work hard to get the most out of yourself and worry about your own team,” Spieth said.
It's all that's left to these players.
18 forats per deixar empremta.
The two best players in the world with more strokes than Spieth and Thomas the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed sensation of the Ryder Cup.
The adorable little girl is from Europe, but she doesn't make any mistakes.
“Moliwood” will be the only one that will not make a bogey on Saturday night, and also will avoid the bogeys on Saturday morning and Friday night, and the last ones on Friday morning at night.
For this result and the way in which his energy seems to flow through the public, it is reaffirmed that it is the players who will be playing on Sunday, and not one of them is more popular than Fleetwood or Molinari to win a possible European victory while the sun is on Le Golf National.
Preferiblement tots dos alhora en forats diferents.
However, talking about European glory seemed premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson will be paired with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning fourballs, in the afternoon fourballs.
A bogey and two doubles for the first time in the history of the Spanish league and the Swedish in a match where they will not have any option to get out.
The Sunday, but there is no one who can help me get out of the hole.
The foursomes and fourballs are very interesting to watch because of the interactions between the players, the clubs that give and the clubs that don't give, and the way a strategy can change from one to the other.
The Americans have played better than the Europeans and they will play better tomorrow, but this foursomes session has shown that the US team has the motivation to fight that some, especially in the US, have questioned.
Europe will win the Ryder Cup with a 10-6 score
Europe will face the final day of the Ryder Cup with a comfortable advantage after winning the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday to take a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The inspiring duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari will try to achieve two victories against Tiger Woods in difficult conditions and leave their record, until now, at Le Golf National.
The European team, captained by Thomas Bjorn, who was hoping to retain the trophy he won two years ago at Hazeltine, will dominate an American team that is not quite sure about the fourballs this morning and will put the series at 3-1.
The US team has shown more resistance in the foursomes and can't reduce the differences.
The equipment of Jim Furyk needed to get eight points in the 12 singles matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first debutant European to make four birdies in a row, while Molinari, who is known as "Molliwood" after a week of sensational play, is the only other player to have done so. The only other pair to have done so are the American duo of Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson, who did so in 2004.
After the defeat of Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, and the brilliant performance of the two players, the debutant American Bryson Dechambeau and Woods won the match 5&4. 
Woods, who had been drenched in two matches on Saturday, will show signs of genius in the short game, but has lost 19 of 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes, and consecutively.
Justin Rose, who is not going to play in the fourballs of the morning, will play with Henrik Stenson in the foursomes and will win by 2 and 1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who are first and third in the world, respectively.
I was in Paris on a sunny day, and the wind was coming from the south-west.
Jordan Spieth, three times champion of the tournament, and Justin Thomas will establish a reference point for Americans on Saturday.
To win a victory with determination against the Espanyol and Ian Poulter and, later, to win again with Ian Poulter and Rory McIlroy in the foursomes, after having lost the first two matches.
Only two times in the history of the Ryder Cup a team has won a match after being four points down, and that was the team of Furyk, defending the title, who only needed to draw to keep it.
No matter, after two days, it seems that the counterattack on Sunday is outside of his reach.
North Korea says it will not disarm unilaterally "in a capricious manner" if there are no signs of confidence
The North Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs will announce on Saturday to the United Nations that the sanctions imposed by the United Nations are intensifying the country's distrust of the United States and that, in these circumstances, the country will not unilaterally eliminate its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho will tell the General Assembly of the United Nations that North Korea has taken "important measures of goodwill" during the past year, including dismantling its nuclear test site and its missile launch pad, and committing to not proliferate nuclear weapons and related technology.
“We will observe the response of the United States,” he said.
“We have no confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, in these circumstances, will not initiate unilateral disarmament in any way.”
If the United States is willing to take the first step to denuclearize North Korea, Pyongyang will respond in kind by taking steps to denuclearize in phases, as North Korea has said it is willing to do.
The Catalan government will make reference to the joint statement that Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump will make at the first summit between a president in office of the United States and a leader of North Korea in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim is going to commit to work on the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula", while Trump will promise guarantees for the security of North Korea.
North Korea has attempted to pose formally to the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States has communicated that before Pyongyang has eliminated its nuclear weapons.
Washington also has to resist to the call to relax the hard sanctions imposed to North Korea.
The United States insists that the first step must be to denuclearize and increase the pressure on North Korea to achieve its objective in a coercive manner, in addition to opposing the "declaration of war" and the "war declaration."
“The perception that the sanctions will harm us is a chimera of the people who do not know us.”
But the problem is that the sanctions are continuing to increase our distrust.
The Catalan government will not refer to the plans to celebrate a second ceremony between Kim and Trump that the leader of the United States will highlight at the beginning of next week.
In this context, the Minister will highlight three meetings between Kim and the leader of South Korea Moon Jae-in in the last five months and will add: "If the party involved in the question of denuclearization is the Republic of Korea, the denuclearization of the peninsula of Korea will not have arrived at this stalemate situation."
The speech that Ri will make today, the one he will make tomorrow, will be very different from the one he made last year, when he declared to the UN General Assembly that launching missiles at the territory of the United States was inevitable after Mr. Evil Trump called Kim Jong-un "Rocket Man" in a suicidal mission.
The Catalan people want to be united with the other nations, Trump, who is going to destroy North Korea completely, will praise Kim Jong-un for taking measures to disarm, but will say that there is still a lot to do and the sanctions must be maintained until North Korea denuclearizes.
Wednesday, Trump will say there was no deadline for this and that "it doesn't matter if it's two years, three years or six months" 
The UN Security Council and Russia support that the Council of Security of the UN has to reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
The US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will declare on Thursday at the UN Security Council that: "The application of sanctions by the Security Council must continue energetically and without exception until the complete and verifiable denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula."
The Catalan Council of Security has imposed sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to cut off the financing of its missile and nuclear programs.
Pompeo is going to find Kim outside the UN General Assembly and then he will return to Pyongyang to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit is not going to go well.
You will leave Pyongyang in July if you have made some achievements, but North Korea will accuse you of "demanding things for a gangster" in a few hours.
In a meeting with Moon scheduled for this month, North Korea has agreed to dismantle a missile testing site and a nuclear complex if the United States takes “measures in accordance” with the agreement.
You know, Kim Jong-un has just communicated to me that he is willing to denuclearize. We're going to have a very good relationship. We're going to have a very good relationship. We're going to have a very good relationship. We're going to have a very good relationship. We're going to have a very good relationship. We're going to have a very good relationship. We're going to have a very good relationship. We're going to have a very good relationship. We're going to have a very good relationship. We're going to have a very good relationship. We're going to have a very good relationship. We're going to have a very good relationship. We're going to have a very good relationship. We're going to have a very good relationship. We're going to have a very good relationship. We're going to have a very good relationship. We're going to have a very good relationship. We're going to have a very good relationship. We're going to have a very good relationship. We're going to have a very good relationship. We're going to have a very good
The students of Harvard University have a course on habits of rest
Enguany, a new course at Harvard University has allowed its students to sleep less, in an attempt to combat the culture, each student is studying longer, all night, stimulated by caffeine.
An academic will observe that sometimes students of the university number u of the world are lost in the basic aspects of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert on sleep at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, is designing the course, which he says is the first of its kind in the United States.
It will inspire us to create a course after the break to see the impact of the loss of sound on learning.
“At the end of the party, a woman says to me: “Why did I have to come to this party, all this time, in my last year?”
You will be surprised to know that no one has spoken about the importance of sound, which thing will surprise you.
In the course, taught for the first time this year, the students are explained the basic concepts on how to improve their academic and sporting performance, as well as their general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of Psychiatry at the Harvard Medical School and director of the psychiatric services at the University, will say that the University will decide to introduce the course after the students have been deprived of their liberty for a week.
The course, of one hour duration, included a series of interactive tasks.
In a section there is an image of a dormitory, the students have to click on the cups of coffee, curtains, blankets and books to get information about the effects of caffeine and light on sports performance and the importance of maintaining a routine to go to sleep.
In another section, it is explained to the participants that the lack of sleep for a long time can increase the risk of suffering from cardiovascular diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, depression and cancer.
Here is a map of the campus with interactive icons that will help you think about your daily route.
We know that the students' conduct will not change immediately.
But we think they have the right to know, just as we have the right to know the effects of smoking cigarettes on our health.
The culture of the Catalan language is still alive, and it will be, I think, that the modern technology and the pressuring of the students will make it disappear. It is a problem that is getting bigger every year.
To ensure that you enjoy a good quality sound for a long time, this would be a "secret weapon" for students to combat stress, tiredness and anxiety, and to avoid getting headaches, as the lack of sound can cause the brain to starve and to go into a state of hunger, which makes the brain lose its ability to concentrate.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying Chemistry and Physics, will help Professor Czeisler design the course, after having attended one of his classes last semester at Harvard.
Raymond will comment that the course has been opened and that he has been inspired to promote the course in the whole campus.
The next step, according to her, is to ask the students of post-graduate studies to do a similar program before they join the competitive institution.
The professor Czeisler will recommend to students to set an alarm clock when they go to sleep and when they wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can alter the harmony of the circadian rhythm and cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal ends Gerrard's homes
The goal of Dolly Menga condemns the disarticulated equipment of Steven Gerrard to a defeat of 1-0 at home to Livingston that supposes another disoriented outside.
Rangers were looking to add to their first victory at Ibrox since February when they beat St Johnstone 4-1 last month, but Gary Holt's side inflicted a second defeat on Gerrard in 18 games as manager, leaving them 8 points behind Hearts, who are unbeaten in the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga will score the goal in the 90th minute, and it will seem like the Rangers, who are lacking inspiration, are equalizing the score.
While the Rangers are in the third place, the Livingston can be in the third position, but the Hibs are in the fourth position, with a difference of goals.
The Rangers could face more difficulties after the judge of the line Calum Spence will need medical attention for a wound caused by an object that apparently was thrown from the stands.
Gerrard will make seven changes to the team that beat Ayr United in the Betfred Cup semi-final.
Holt, on the other side, will start with the same eleven that played against Hearts last week. Of course, he will feel satisfied for the way his team, well organized, will suffocate their rivals in every moment.
If the Rangers dominate the possession, the Livingston will create more danger than when they have the ball.
In the first 2 minutes of the game, when Menga has scored, the first intervention of Scot Pittman leaves Allan McGregor in front of Allan McGregor, but the midfielder will be diverted and will miss the great opportunity.
A foul from Keaghan Jacobs will be challenged by Craig Halkett, but Alan Lithgow will only be able to divert the ball away from the goal.
The Rangers have the control, but they seem to have more hope than the team in their final game.
Alfredo Morelos thought he would have had a penalty at the 15th minute, as Steven Lawless and Steven Lawless were top-class, but the referee Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian’s claims.
Rangers will only have to deal with two crosses at the first gate, but the first gatekeeper, Liam Kelly, will not have any problems with the cap of Lassana Coulibaly and the docile defender Ovie Ejaria.
While the first act of the Livy the minute 34 could have been against the race, no one can deny that he deserves only for his effort.
Again, the Rangers will not be able to break the work of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield will not react when Declan Gallagher passes the ball to Scott Robinson, who will keep his calm to score a simple goal.
Gerrard will act as a substitute in the change for Coulibaly for Ryan Kent. The change will have a significant impact, as the extreme will make a pass to Morelos, and Kelly will run to the block.
Although, the Livingston will continue to attract the attention of the visitors playing exactly as the Lithgow and Halkett make long passes, one to the other.
The band of Holt could have given up the lead, but McGregor will keep fighting until Jacobs is out of the corner.
The Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton is asking for a second yellow card for a foul on Jacobs, but the referee is not giving the yellow card.
The inventor of the Geiger counter
I am a page from the "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, which is 136 years old and counting... the day when the physicist, Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, was born in Germany.
Geiger will develop a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that will finally give us access to what we know as a “Geiger counter”.
The Geiger counter, which is a pillar of science in the past, will also become a pillar of popular culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, apparently failed physicists:
Home: "What the hell is this?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, which is used to find radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put your ear to the radioactivity, you can hear the effects of the atoms that emanate from the radioactivity of the minerals.
Evans: "It's really exploding!"
Hans Geiger will die in 1945, a few days after his 63rd birthday.
But the name he bears is still alive.
A new vaccine against cancer could help the immune system to “see” the malignant cells
A new vaccine against cancer could help the immune system to “see” and eliminate cancer cells
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells as part of the treatment
The method implies the extraction of immune cells from a patient and changing them in the laboratory
It is possible to see a common protein in many cancers and, then, reinject them
A vaccine of proof is showing promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who was vaccinated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells, will see disappear the ovarian cancer that she was suffering from for more than 18 months.
The method implies the extraction of immune cells from a patient, alter them in the laboratory to be able to "see" a protein present in many types of cancer (HER2) and, later, inject them.
According to Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland (USA): "The results suggest that we have a promising vaccine."
The protein HER2 “favours the growth of various types of cancer”, including breast, ovary, lung and colorectal, has explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar focus to that of the immune cells of the patients and “educate” them to attack the cancer cells has been successful in treating a type of leukemia.
Kanye West is going to wear a MAGA hat in a pro-Trump diatribe after his SNL performance.
No it will not end
Kanye West will be invited to the SNL studio after his performance on Saturday Night Live, which was chaotic and he congratulated Donald Trump, and said he would run for president in 2020.
After his third song of the night, titled Ghost Town, in which he wore a hat with the slogan "Make America Great Again", he will start criticizing the Democrats and reiterate his support for Trump.
When I speak with white people: Can I please ask Trump if he can like me?
If you are concerned about racism, you should have been protesting in the United States a long time ago.
The SNL program will start with a parody of Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star is mocked for the witness Brett Kavanaugh before the Senate Judiciary Committee for the sexual assault allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Even if it doesn't happen, Chris Rock will be performing at the Comedy Store to protest the disapproval of West on the social networks.
It is not clear if Rock wanted to ridicule West with the publication.
The Catalan people have to be treated with respect, and the gorra is a symbol of that respect.
The Catalan government is threatening to take action against the Basque Country.
You're not going out with that hat on.
In assetjar.
I am in a position of inferiority
West is going to continue: "Do you want to see the inferior position?" while he is posing the cape of Superman so that he can not say what he has to do. "Do you want the world to advance?"
Proveu d’estimar.
The comments of the public have provoked the editors of the program to be more careful in the future and the members of the program seem to be very upset, according to Variety, which had a reporter who was going to explain to the public: "The study will be completely mut."
West is going to bring a substitute for the last minute of Ariana Grande, the ex of the rapper Mac Miller, who died a few days ago.
West will leave perplexed the good part of the public and the interpretation of the song I Love it, disfressed from a bottle of Perrier.
West will get the recovery of the head of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who will say: "One of the most valuable spirits: THANK YOU FOR SHINING ON THE MULTITUD."
But the presenter of the debate, Karen Hunter, will tweet that West simply was "who you are and who you are absolutely marvelous."
But he has not rewarded anyone (buying his music or stealing or giving support to his "art") who adopts and defends an ideology that harms my community.
It is free.
We also, will add.
Before the program, the rapper will announce on Twitter that he has been nominated and that he is the "the one before Kanye West".
It is not the first artist who is changing his name and follows the steps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague rapper, Snoop Dogg, before Prince, who was already a legend in the music industry, and after his disappearance, the artist known as Prince.
Accusation of attempted murder in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder following an attempted murder in Belfast on Thursday.
According to the police, the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
We hope that the accused will appear before the Belfast Crown Court on Monday.
The fiscalia will review the charges.
The Star of Joc de trons, Kit Harington, denounces a toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for playing the paper of the espadac of the medieval fantasy violent series of HBO Game of Thrones.
Although, the actor, 31 years old, has denounced the stereotype of the hero, saying that these papers often give the impression that young people have to be strong to be respected.
In an interview with the Sunday Times Culture magazine, Kit said he believed “something was wrong” and that he was “questioning how to deal with toxic masculinity in the era of #MeToo.”
Kit, who recently got married to the co-protagonist of Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, has admitted that she has the determination to face this problem.
“Personally, I am asking myself if they are right in saying that masculinity is a social construct”, he says.
“What have we learned from the homes during their development in relation to the problem that they are experiencing?”
According to Kit, the television can be held responsible for the increase of toxic masculinity thanks to its characters so virile.
You add: “What is innate and what is acquired?”
What is the meaning of the television and the careers that make the young people feel that they have to have this facet of virility?
I think it is one of the great questions of our time: how do I live?
Because we are not sure about what we have done with the young people.
In the interview, he also admits that he would not do a prequel or sequel to the series when the final episode is scheduled for the summer, but that he is doing battles and horses.
From November, Kit will be the protagonist of the play True West by Sam Shepard, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor is going to reveal soon that knowing his girlfriend Rose is the best thing that has happened to him.
“I have met my future wife, so I will give my future family and my life ahead.”
The paper rose of Ygritte, the love of the character that represents Kit, Jon Snow, to the fantasy series of the Emmy.
The wedding will take place in June 2018 at the family farm of Leslie, in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: The Xina notifies an increase of 14% of cases
The Xina has announced an increase of 14% in the number of citizens with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820.000 people affected in the country, according to the health authorities.
Only the second quarter of 2018 will be declared 40.000 cases.
The vast majority of cases are of sexual transmission, the difference from what was passing.
Traditionally, HIV is rapidly propagated in some regions of China because of infected blood transfusions.
Although the number of people who contract HIV through this case has been reduced to zero, according to the statements of the health workers in Yunnan Province.
The number of people with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sexual intercourse is a problem for the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality is decriminalized in the Xina in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community is common.
Taking into account the conservative values of the country, the studies estimate that between 70 and 90% of those who maintain homosexual relationships will marry a woman.
Many of the transmissions of diseases are due to the lack of adequate precautions in sexual relations.
From 2003, the government of the Xina has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to confront the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a former employee of the Senate Democratic Caucus leaked confidential information to the press and “dangerous conspiracy theories”
The representative of the United States Maxine Waters will denounce on Saturday the accusations according to which a member of her personal had published personal information of three Republican senators of the United States on the pages of the Wikipedia of the legislators.
The Democratic mayor of Los Angeles will claim that the demands are being made by the extreme right wing.
“Mentides, mentides and more mentides”, says Waters in a Twitter statement.
Apparently, the information published contained the addresses and phone numbers of the senators from South Carolina Lindsey Graham and Utah Orrin Hatch.
The information will be available online on Thursday and will be published in the Senate Judiciary Committee during a session on Thursday on the allegations of sexual abuse against the candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
The information will be filtered after three senators question Kavanaugh.
The Gateway Pundit and RedState are reporting that the IP address that identifies the source of the posts was associated with Waters' office and that a member of Waters' staff was involved in the leak.
This allegation without foundation is completely false and a pure lie,
The member of my personal, the identity, the personal data and the security of the quality that has been compromised by these false and fraudulent denunciations, will not be responsible for any way of this information leakage.
This denunciation is completely false and has no foundation.
The declaration of Waters will generate criticism in the line rapidly, including the of the press secretary of the White House, Ari Fleischer.
This is a full of indignation
This makes me think that you don't have the temperament to be a member of the Congress.
If someone is accused of something they haven't done, they shouldn't get angry.
No one should be shown as a defiant.
You must not question the motives of the accuser.
I have to keep my calm and my serenity.
Fleischer seemed to compare the reaction of Waters to the criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who the critics accuse of seeming angry during the session on Tuesday.
Omar Navarro, a candidate for the Republican Party, was also present at the elections of the middle legislative term, and also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
Important if it's true, you'll have to admit it.
According to his statement, Waters will say that his office had alerted the authorities and the security forces of these fraudulent declarations.
“We will ensure that the criminals are revealed, and that they will continue, “and that they will be legally responsible for all the actions that they have committed and that they have caused damage to all and each of my staff.”
Review of Johnny English Strikes Again: parody of limited spy
It is a tradition to refer to the Brexit in any new film with a British focus, and this release of the parody-action-comedy of Johnny English, which was released in 2003 with Johnny English and will be released again in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn, is no exception.
This humorous auto-satire about the lack of men’s underwear will be a new opportunity for export from the country?
In any case, the incompetent of the English sort of gum and the face of rubber Johnny English can renew his license for a second time to be able to drive him. His name indicates more than that it is a comic creation designed for the territories of English speaking countries. 
Obviously, it's the stupid secret agent who, despite his rare glamor, has a little bit of Clouseau, a bit of Mr. Bean and a touch of this pair that brings a single note to the theme of Cars at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
Originally, it was based on the international and mysterious Atkinson who represented the forgotten ads of Barclaycard, which were sowing chaos.
Hi, I had a good time on this last trip to JE.
I loved the Johnny English who slept in a medieval armor and the blades of the helicopter were hitting him.
I like the idea of Atkinson for the physical comedy, but the humor seems to be quite fluid and unnecessary, especially since serious films like "007" and "Mission Impossible" already include it.
The humor seemed to be directed at children rather than adults, and for me, the absurd adventures of Johnny English are not as funny or well-executed as the gags of Mr. Bean, who represents Atkinson.
The frequently repeated thesis that Great Britain is in serious problems.
A pirate informatic has infiltrated the secret network of British spies and has revealed the identities of all the British agents on the territory, which causes consternation to the agent of service, a paper lamentably small for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last time for a prime minister who is a pretentious and self-important figure, who has already collapsed totally in terms of political popularity: Emma Thompson gives the best of her in this character, but the script does not go beyond that.
The intelligence officers inform that, in the case that each spy acted in peril, there will be no retirement.
I think this is the worst Johnny English movie, but it’s still funny. Johnny English is a spy who is trying to get back into the spy business, but he’s not very good at it. He’s trying to get into a school for spies, but he’s not very good at that either. He’s trying to get into a school for spies, but he’s not very good at that either. He’s trying to get into a school for spies, but he’s not very good at that either. He’s trying to get into a school for spies, but he’s not very good at that either. He’s trying to get into a school for spies, but he’s not very good at that either. He’s trying to get into a school for spies, but he’s not very good at that either. He’s trying to get into a school for spies, but he’s not very good at that either. He’s trying to get into a school for spies, but he’s not very good at that either. He’s trying to get into a school for spies, but he’s not very good at that either.
Whitehall has called an emergency meeting of the Catalan government to discuss the situation in Catalonia.
Ara Bough is a home boy, living in a submarine, a very enthusiastic paper, where Vicki Pepperdine is a little bit under-appreciated.
Yes, the Batman and Robin of when things are getting out of hand in the service of the King, they are going to be in action and find a new member in Olga Kurylenko, the spectacular “femme fatale” Ophelia Bulletova.
The first minister is under pressure, as the billionaire technologist claims he can solve the problems of Great Britain: the sinister Jason Volta, represented by Jake Lacy.
Catalan: 
All the parades have certainly been taken out of this last sequence, but with all the simplicity and the sweetness that it presents, it seems like a children’s program.
Things that are quite normal.
With the other Johnny English films, it has been difficult to think if the film industry has given Rowan Atkinson a paper that does justice to his talent.
The Labour Party denies that it is proposing a four-day week for Britons, saying that the British have a five-day working week and a three-day weekend
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbyn will have to consider a radical change in the way it works if it wants to win the next election.
As a result, the companies that are using the technology are getting better results, and the workers are getting more free time.
The employees will enjoy a week of three days, but they will not be able to do so.
According to the fonts, the idea would fit in with the economic agenda of the party and the plans to improve the situation of the workers.
The change to a week's work in four days counts with the support of the Trades Union Congress, as a method to ensure workers can benefit from the economic change.
A Labour Party expert is expected to announce that the party will review its policy on independence before the end of the year.
It will not be the night of the day, but a week of work is a working week that fits into the perspective of the party to balance the economy in favor of the worker and in the industrial strategy of the party.
The Labour Party would not be the first to give its support to this idea, as the Green Party has already promised a week of four-day working during the general elections in 2017.
Although this is not the case, the Labour Party does not support this aspiration at present.
According to a statement from the Labour Party: “A week of work is not a political issue and the party is not a political party.”
The shadow chancellor John McDonnell will use the party conference next week to detail his vision for a socialist economy.
McDonnell will make a statement on the determination to restore the power of the "anonymous directors" and the "speculators" to the public services.
The plans of the minister also include that the shareholders of the water companies could not recover the whole investment, as the Labour government could apply "deductions" for the crimes that have been committed.
The Catalan government has also confirmed plans to set up a fund to buy shares in companies and create a 10% stake in the shares of private companies in the sector, which are expected to receive dividends of around 500 GBP per year.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy explains to "60 Minutes" that the FBI investigation of Kavanaugh could change his opinion.
The FBI investigation of the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week, and has raised the question of whether the agency's findings could influence any Republican senator to withdraw their support.
In an interview that will be published on Sunday, the correspondent of "60 Minutes" Scott Pelley will ask the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could have changed the light to change their opinion.
Kennedy showed more openness than his colleague from South Carolina.
I'm serious, I'm serious.
I have spoken with Judge Kavanaugh.
I have been accused of having committed a crime, and I have asked if he has done it.
He was showing determination and was determined.
But Graham's vote seems to be very important.
I have the opinion of Brett Kavanaugh and I would present a very explosive accusation.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but she’s here: Brett Kavanaugh is going to deny it, absolutely.”
“I can’t name the people who will be able to verify it.”
36 years old.
I don't see that I need to change anything.
What is the Global Citizen Festival? Has it reduced poverty?
New York will host the Global Citizen Festival this Saturday, an annual music festival, which presents a program of stars absolutely impressive, which ends a mission equally impressive: eradicate poverty in the world.
In the 2019 edition of the Global Citizen Festival, thousands of people will gather in Central Park to celebrate the work of global leaders and to take action to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which will start in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a group of international activists who hope to end poverty by increasing the number of people who help to combat it.
For free entrance to the event (if anyone wants to pay for a VIP ticket), the assistants have to do a series of tasks, such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a prank phone call or any other activity to wake up the consciousness about the goal of ending poverty.
Quins exit the Global Citizen project after 12 years to reach their goal
The idea of giving a free concert to the people is a good way to persuade them to shout out or simply to make a call for "clictivism" (people who think that the difference is made by signing a petition online or sending a tweet)
From the year 2011, Global Citizen has registered more than 19 million "actions" from its sympathizers, who have helped to solve various objectives.
Declares that these actions have helped to stimulate global leaders to announce commitments and political commitments equivalent to more than 37,000 million USD, which will have an impact on the lives of more than 2,250 million people before 2030.
From 2018, the group will have 390 commitments and commitments derived from its actions, of which 10,000 million USD have been recovered or recaptured.
The group estimates that the protected areas have had a direct impact on 649 million people around the world.
Some of the main commitments include the Power of Nutrition, a group of investors and philanthropists with its headquarters in the United Kingdom, which is committed to "help children grow as much as possible" and has promised to send $35 million to Rwanda to help combat malnutrition in the country after more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“Thank you to the government of the United Kingdom, to the governments of the nations that support, to the governors of the national governments and to the members of Global Citizens, like you, who can turn the injustice of malnutrition into a page in the history of humanity”, said the ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, to the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group will also explain that after more than 5,000 actions demanding better nutrition for children, the UK government will announce the financing of a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million children and infants with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the P+F of your website that asked "what do you think that can end up with extreme poverty?",
Global Citizen respongué: "It will be a long and hard road. Sometimes we will fall and get up again."
But with the great movements of defence of civil rights and against apartheid, we will win, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are some of the artists who will perform at the 2019 Global Citizen Festival in New York, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the "blockade" of the Spanish ports to obstruct the export of Russian energy (Interior Secretary)
Washington Post: "If it's necessary, we will have to go to the Mediterranean to prevent the Russian energy from reaching the markets, including the markets of the Middle East, as well as the markets of Europe," said the Secretary of the Interior, Ryan Zinke, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke has denounced that the Russian intervention in Syria, mainly, is operating with the invitation of the legitimate government, and it is a pretext to explore our energy markets.
“I think that the motive for the movement is the will to negotiate with energy, as it is already happening in the East of Europe,” he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to face this question.
The United States have the capacity, together with the Navy, to guarantee that the maritime routes are open and, if necessary, to block, to prevent the energy from entering the market.
Zinke was addressing the audience at the event organized by Consumer Energy Alliance, a group without a lobbyist for the energy consumer in the US.
Compare the strategies of Washington to negotiate with Russia and Iran, and you will see that they are the same.
“The economic option to Iran and Russia consists, more or less, in profiting and substituting for fuels”, he said, while indicating that Russia only has a reserve, since its economy depends on fossil fuels.
The declarations arrive while the Trump administration has been on a mission to promote the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe, in place of Russian gas, the most economic option for European consumers.
With this final goal, the officials of the Trump administration, including the President of the United States, Donald Trump, try to persuade Germany to abandon the Nord Stream 2 project, which, according to Trump, will make Berlin a "captive" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly insisted that the Nord Stream 2 project, which has cost $11 billion and will double the capacity of the existing gas pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is purely economic.
The Kremlin argues that the opposition's fierce criticism of the project is due to economic reasons and is an example of the country's political independence.
I believe that we share the opinion that energy cannot be a weapon to pressure consumers, and that the consumers must be able to choose their suppliers, said the Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after a meeting with the US Energy Secretary Rick Perry, held in Moscow in September.
The US position has provoked a negative response from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main organization of the German industry, FDI (Federation of German Industries), has called on the EU to separate the energy policy from the EU and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
I have a big problem when a third state interferes in our energy policy," said Dieter Kempf, director of BDI (Federation of German Industries) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Senator Elizabeth Warren from Massachusetts has said she will “seriously consider” running for president in 2020.
The Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren is expected to announce her candidacy for the presidency after the midterm elections.
During a municipal meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirms that she would consider running for president.
The women have arrived in Washington and are fixing the fracture of the government, which the women occupy other important positions.
“After November 6, I will take my candidacy for president seriously.”
Warren will intervene during the municipal meeting and will say that "he was leading the country in the wrong direction".
I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy.
Warren has been very frank and critical of Trump and his nominee for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On a Thursday, Warren will say: "It is clear that the FBI has been investigating before the elections."
A poll that was published yesterday showed that a majority of Warren's voters think she won't run in 2020.
A majority of likely Massachusetts voters say they would not vote for Elizabeth Warren if she ran for president, according to a Suffolk University/Boston Globe poll.
The thirty-two percent of Catalans support the candidacy.
The poll will reveal a much larger support for the candidacy of former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent in favor and 48 percent against.
Other names of the Democratic candidates that are going to be taken into account in relation to a possible candidacy for 2020 include Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders from Vermont.
Biden will announce his decision officially to the president, according to Associated Press.

The States of Catalonia and the District of Columbia support the legal challenge to a new policy of the United States that denies asylum to victims who flee domestic violence or gang violence
Representatives of 18 states and the District of Columbia will file an amicus brief on Friday in Washington to support a refugee who challenged the Trump administration's policy, according to NBC News.
The full name of the request of the Grace vs Sessions case that the United States for Civil Liberties will present against the federal policy in August has not been revealed.
You will say that the wife of the member of the violent band was "and the children of the band" was attacked, but the American officials will deny her request for asylum on July 20.
The van to drive to Texas.
The lawyers of the states that support Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where there is a great number of applicants for asylum in the United States, as countries that face general problems of domestic violence and domestic abuse.
The new asylum policy of the United States revoked a decision of 2014 of the Board of Appeals of Immigration, which allowed undocumented immigrants to seek asylum from domestic violence.
The District of Columbia's Attorney General Karl Racine is expected to declare on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international legislation."
The federal laws require that asylum requests be adjudicated according to the facts and circumstances of the request, and this prohibition infringes on this principle, according to the amicus curiae.
The lawyers also argue that the policy that denies entry to immigrants is bad for the economy of the United States, because it is more likely that successful entrepreneurs and "jobs that Americans won't do" will be created.
In June, the US Attorney General Jeff Sessions will order the judges of immigration to not grant asylum to victims who flee domestic violence and gangs.
The asylum is available for those people who leave their country for persecution or for reasons of race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group or political opinion.
The asylum is the only place where all the problems can be solved, not only the most serious ones, but also the most common ones, which people face every day.
Efforts to rescue the desperate in Palu are at the limit to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is getting more desperate.
The air is very hot", said Risa Kusuma, 35, while calmly watching her son with fever in a hospital in the city of Palu, which was destroyed by the earthquake and tsunami.
Every minute, an ambulance carries someone.
There is no potable water.
The residents have visited their destroyed houses to see if they can salvage anything.
There are hundreds of thousands of people, and the hospitals, badly damaged by the earthquake of magnitude 7.5, are saturated.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who broke his leg, are out of the hospital military of Palu, because the patients are being treated outside due to the strong shocks that are repeated.
The police have not yet explained how the violent terratrèmol has been able to break into the fifth floor of the hotel where the woman and her daughter were staying.
“There is no time to save us.”
He was trapped in the ruins of the house, he said, and he added that his family had witnessed a wedding in the village.
“I felt my wife asking for help crying, and then I didn’t feel her anymore.”
I don't know what happened to her and to my daughter.
I hope you're well.
The US ambassador to China accuses the Chinese government of "propaganda announcements".
One week after a Chinese official publication published a four-page advertisement in a North American newspaper promoting the advantages of trade between the United States and China, the U.S. ambassador to China has accused Beijing of using the newspaper to spread propaganda.
President Donald Trump is scheduled to address the Chinese Daily Supplement to the Des Moines Register, the most popular newspaper in the state of Iowa, after accusing the Xina of interfering in the November 6 elections in the United States, an accusation that the Xina denies.
The accusation of Trump against Beijing that Beijing is interfering in the US elections will mark the beginning of a new phase of the US campaign against China. The US officials have told Reuters that this is a new phase of the US campaign against China.
It is normal for the governments of foreign countries to insert advertisements in the local press, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a trade war that is intensifying and that has pushed the barriers to trade between the two countries.
The aranzels of the Xina are being broken by the war of the principi of the commercial war, which has the objectiu of castigar the exportadors of the states, like Iowa, that have supported the Partit Republicà of Trump, according to experts xinesos and nord-americans.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, said that Beijing has harmed the workers, farmers and businesses in the United States.
China, Branstad will write an article in an opinion piece to The Des Moines Register: "is redoubling the asset of advertising in our free press."
“In order to promote the free speech and the freedom of the press, the governor uses the respected tradition of the free press in the United States of America, by inserting an advertisement of payment to The Des Moines Register.”
In the change, all who have come to Beijing will find few differences and will not see a real reflection of the opinions of the Chinese citizens on the economic trajectory of the country, until the means of communication are dominated by the Communist Party of China.
He added that one of the most important newspapers in China, which he did not name, had declined to publish the article.
The Republicans are the voters of women before the midterm elections, as the disaster of Kavanaugh, warn the analysts
Many of the main Republican leaders are supporting and defending Brett Kavanaugh, who is facing various sexual assault allegations, and the analysts have pointed out that they expect a negative response, especially among women, to the midterm elections.
The emotions that surround this case are extremely high and the majority of the Republicans already show that they want to make a step forward with a referendum.
These things cannot be done", he will explain Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell School of Syracuse University, in an article that will be published Saturday.
Reeher will say that the last-minute pressure from Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to delay the FBI investigation is sufficient to calm the angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened today, nor will they forget what happens tomorrow, nor will they forget what happens in November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, principal adviser and national portavoz of the progressive group MoveOn, on Thursday, according to the Washington Post.
Friday morning, the Protestants are crying "November is coming!" (November is coming) while they are demonstrating in the Senate vestibule while the Republicans who control the Judicial Committee decide to continue with the nomination of Kavanaugh despite the testimony of the Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to the Mic.
The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be outside the graphic,
The people who have been here before are all dead; it is certain.
But I could have done more, especially among women and young people, between 18 and 29 years old, who do not vote while they do not like the president.
After the testimony of Ford, before the confirmation of Kavanaugh, the analysts suggested that the Republicans could get a negative answer if they pressed hard.
“This is a big embolic for the GOP,” Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the vote of the Senate or the final vote. It’s also about how Kavanaugh will be treated by the Republicans. He also has to answer for how they have handled this issue and how they have treated her,” said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a Democratic group that helps elect Democrats, to CNN.
The Americans seem to be divided between those who believe in the Ford testimony and those who believe in Kavanaugh’s testimony, and the balance is clearly in favor of the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41% of the respondents believe Ford's testimony is "indubitably true" or "probably true", while 35% believe Kavanaugh's testimony is "indubitably true" or "probably true".
More than 38 percent said they believed Kavanaugh had lied under oath, while 30 percent said they believed Ford.
After the pressure from Flake, the FBI is now investigating the allegations against Ford and, at the very least, another woman, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford will testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee next week under oath that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her under the influence of alcohol when they were both 17 years old.
Ramirez says that the candidate for the Supreme Court will show his genitals at a party while studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the web is launching a new company that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The last project of the legend of technology, Inrupt, is a company that is based on the open source platform of Berners-Lee.
The Solid platform allows users to sort out their data and only certain people can access it.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokes that the hidden intention of Inrupt is "to dominate the world".
I have to do it, I have to do it, I have to do it.
It is a historical moment.
The application uses the Solid technology platform to allow users to create their own "personal data space" or a POD.
To contain lists of contacts, lists of tasks pending, a calendar, a music library and other professionals and personal contacts.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify. They are all available in a browser now.
The person who is excluded from the scope of the data in the personal data file is the user who decides who can access the information.
The company is called "empowerment through personal data".
The idea of Inrupt, according to the delegate of the company, John Bruce, is that the company integrates resources, processes and skills adequate so that the platform Solid is available to everyone.
The company is currently formed by Berners-Lee, Bruce, a platform for security acquired by IBM, some developers contracted to work on the project and a community of voluntary coders.
From this week, developers from all over the world can create their own decentralized applications using the decentralized applications available at the decentralized web location of Inrupt.
Berners-Lee is going to say that none of his team is talking about "Facebook and Google" about a "radical change" in all business models.
“We are not asking for permission.”
In a Medium post on Saturday, Berners-Lee writes that the “mission of Inrupt is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web integrated into the Solid platform.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
The next two months, Berners-Lee has been a very influential voice in the debate over the neutrality of the network.
During the interruption of the Inrupt conference, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“Incredibly optimistic about this new era of the web”, says Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the clergy of the Church of the Holy Cross of the First General Chapter
The only priest of the English Church who will be canonized during the First World War as a combatant has been honored by his city 100 years after his death.
The colonel and reverent Bernard Vann obtained the guard on September 29, 1918 for the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
Although, it is true that it will be shot down by a fighter four days later and he will not know that he has been awarded the highest military honor of the British.
The two of us will unveil a commemorative plaque on Saturday at the Rushden Carnival.
One of his nephews, Michael Vann, will say that it was "magnificent" that the diamond was presented exactly 100 years after the theft of the original.
According to The London Gazette, 29 September 1918, the Colonel Vann will command the 2nd Battalion through a very thick fog and under the intense fire of artillery and machine guns.
Later, when the line is clear, I will run to the finish line and, with the maximum effort, I will push the boat with one oar and leave three members of the team behind.
The colonel will be shot by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just one month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann (72) will say that the actions of his father and mother were a proposal that could never be equaled, which produces a feeling of humility.
And the band's director, Dr. James Vann, will also be leaving a wreath after the parade, directed by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann will say that he felt very honored to be part of the parade and will add that the value of a true hero is demonstrated by his willingness to sacrifice himself for many people.
The MMA fans of the MMA that will stay awake all night to watch Bellator 206, will see Peppa Pig in their place
Imagine you are awake all night to watch Bellator 206 and that we deny you the opportunity to see the most important event.
The San José billboard contained 13 lights, including six of the main tower and could be seen by all of the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6:00, when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald are preparing for the fight, the spectators of the United Kingdom will be stunned when the programming will change to Peppa Pig.
Some people were annoyed because they had to stay awake all night to see the demonstration.
A Twitter follower will describe the changes in the drawings as "a man vomiting".
The Catalan government has decided that the 6:00 a.m. slot is not appropriate, so they are changing the programing to children.
Peppa the pig, yes.
The president of Bellator, Scott Coker, will say that they will work on programming for the United Kingdom in the future.
“When I think about it, I think it can work”, says Coker.
But all the same, we are not able to get up before 8 o’clock in the morning and we can’t get up before 8 o’clock on Monday.
But we are working.
I'm sorry, but when I changed channel, there were many messages that came in and I didn't like all of them.
We are trying to resolve this problem, we think it is a technical problem.
But it wasn't like that. It was a problem of the government.
I promise you that I will not pass again.
I'll leave it in cinc lluites, in place of sis. I'll try to make it show up for the followers, but it's going to end.
It's a bad situation.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior about his sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he has felt inferior to the rest of the world because of his sexuality, but that it will give him the motivation to win.
The 24-year-old athlete has declared that he will not go to school until he goes to secondary school, which is not the case for everyone.
In the Desert Island Discs programme on Radio 4, Lauren Laverne said that she was talking about the rights of gay people to give hope to other people.
I also think that it is important to remember that the Olympics are still going on.
The regular presenter of the long-running programme, Kirsty Young, has been off sick for several months.
Daley, who will appear on the first episode of Laverne, will say that she felt "less than" the others because "it was not acceptable socially for children and children".
I will tell you the next: "Today, those feelings of inferiority and difference, have been real things that have given me the power and the strength to triumph".
I want to prove that there was "something", I mean, not to deceive anyone who might have thought that I was gay.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist in the 400m freestyle has become a prominent promoter of the LGBT movement and has used his image to demand that the Commonwealth Games in Australia take a stand against homophobia.
You said you were happy because you could live openly without any restrictions and you wanted to give hope to other people.
The world's most famous gay man is going to explain that he fell in love with a man, the American director Dustin Lance Black, who is going to meet in 2013, "to grab him by the throat".
Last year, Daley is going to marry the Oscar winner, 20 years older than her, but the difference in age has never been a problem.
According to what I have read, when he was 14 years old and he participated in his first Olympics, it was difficult to find someone of the same age who had experienced the same highs and lows.
The couple will be married in June of a child and a man named Robert Ray Black-Daley. According to Daley, "all his perspective" has canvied.
If I had asked you last year what you needed, you would have said an Olympic gold medal.
There are more important things than the Olympic medals.
My Olympic gold medal is my Robbie.
His son is as good as his father, Robert, who is going to die in 2011, at the age of 40, of a brain tumor.
According to Daley, his father did not accept that he had to die and one of the last things he asked for was if he had the tickets for London 2012, because he wanted to be in the first row.
“I couldn’t say “stop, you won’t be able to occupy the first row”, he’ll say.
While he was holding her, he let her breathe and she would not be alive anymore, that is, I finally accepted that he was not invincible.
Next year, Daley will compete in the 2012 Olympics and will win the bronze.
“I knew that was what I had to do: jump in front of a crowd at home in the Olympics. There was no better feeling,” he said.
Also, the song that inspired the first part of the show (Proud by Heather Small), which accompanied the preparations for the Olympics and which still gives me goosebumps.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson will present the Ryder Cup team on Saturday
The American Phil Mickelson will break a record on Sunday by playing his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to change his physical state if he wants to avoid a disappointing finish.
Mickelson, who will participate in the biennial event for the 12th time, will be presented by captain Jim Furyk for the “fourballs” and “foursomes” on Saturday.
In place of being at the center of the action, as has been the case in the United States, the referee of the main tournaments distributes his time between being an announcer and working on the game, with the hope of correcting what he does wrong.
He has not had the most direct drivers, nor as much as the moment of his career, but the 48-year-old player is not the ideal option for the difficult trajectory of Le Golf National, on the long rough is accustomed to punish the off-line shots.
If his own trajectory is not as promising, Mickelson, at the next round, will face the precise camp of the British Open, Francesco Molinari, who has joined the rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win the four matches this week.
If the Americans, four points ahead at the start of the 12 matches, start strongly, the match of Mickelson could become absolutely crucial.
Furyk will express confidence in this home, without being able to say much more.
“You will hear perfectly the role you will play on that day, and you will give a slap on the shoulder and you will be ready for the end.”
I have a lot of confidence in myself.
It's a famous place and he has contributed a lot to these equipments previously and this week.
Probably, I didn't think he was going to play two games.
I have imagined more, but I have imagined that I have to train and I have imagined that I have to advance.
He will be the same, as any other.
Mickelson will break the record of Nick Faldo for the most games played in the Ryder Cup.
To mean the end of a career at the Ryder Cup that has not been equal to his individual record.
Mickelson has won 18 tournaments, 20 defeats and 7 ties, and that is what Furyk said that his presence has brought intangible benefits to the team.
“He is funny, sarcastic, he likes to joke, he likes to make fun of people and he is a great company for the team.”
“I think that the younger players are also enjoying this week, which is something that has been very enjoyable to see.”
Add more to the band of your game.
The European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the advantage is to be exploited
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows that starting with a considerable advantage in the last day of Ryder Cup is easy to convert into a hard day.
The Catalan Open will start next year at Valderrama, where Seve Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the American team, but in the end they will win by the minimum, 14.5-13.5.
“And I would like to say that we have a great advantage at Valderrama; we have a great advantage at Brookline, we will lose, but at Valderrama, we will win, but for a little bit”, he said, after the image, after seeing the victory of the team of 2018, 5-3, yesterday, and the one of today, 10-6, at Le Golf National.
The history has taught me and all the members of the team that it is not yet over.
We have to go all the way to the machine.
It must come out and be done.
This doesn't end until the last point is scored.
We have a goal, to try to win the trophy, and we have to keep our concentration to do it.
Yes, I have said it, in the 12 players that we have in the team, but also I have present here some of our rivals: the best players in the world.
I am very happy with the way my players have played in a demanding golf course, Bjorn has added: “I will not rush with this.
Tomorrow will be different.
The individual payment will make the difference and will change everything.
It's fantastic to be here with a great company, but the individual duels put to the test your maximum capacity to play golf.
This is the message you have to send to the players, the best of you tomorrow.
At this moment, leave your company and he will come out and also the best of it.
In opposition to Bjorn, the captain rival, Jim Furyk, expects that his players will play better individually than in the team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who will add three points.
Furyk knows all the details of the last day's remuntades, because he is going to be part of the winning team in Brookline before finishing the match.
“I remember all the words”, he answered when asked about how he would motivate Ben Crenshaw, the captain of the 1999 team, after the last day.
“We have 12 important matches today, but we want to start with a good one, like the one in Brookline and Medinah.
There is a team that is inspired, there is a lot of pressure in these central matches.
We are preparing the team in function of the circumstances and the best way to do it.
Thomas has the opportunity to try to start the counter-attack against Rory McIlroy in the main duel, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the rest of the European players in the first round.
“I have been training for this for four years because I believe that I can win all the individual races.”
The new German warplane, postponed again
The new German battleship will be ready for action in 2014, but it will not replace the old battleships of the Cold War era, but it will be able to do so, at least, until the end of the year, when the systems are defective and the cost will increase, according to local sources.
The finalization of the “Rheinland-Pfalz”, the main ship of the new class Baden-Württemberg, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the German newspaper Die Zeit, which cites a military port.
The ship will be ready to join the Navy in 2014, but the problems that followed the construction have marked the end of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg class ships that the German Navy will replace in 2007 will be the Bremen class frigates.
It is believed that it will include a potent cannon, a set of missiles and anti-aircraft missiles, as well as technology against stealth attacks, such as a radar reduced, infrared, acoustic signatures and signatures.
Other characteristics to be highlighted include longer maintenance periods: it would be possible to use the new fragments for two years without passing through national ports.
The idiots, who are still in the past, who are supposed to be able to project a powerful force to the outside, will be obsolete when they enter into operation, according to Die Zeit.
The unfortunate frigate F125 will be news next year, when the German Navy will take back the frigate and return it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy returned a vessel to the shipyard in a completely dismantled state.
We know very little about the details of the mission, but the German media have cited various "defects in materials and technical" that would make the vessel unusable in combat missions.
The technical problems are important, because almost 120 sailors, the majority of the crew needed for the old Bremen class frigates, or operate in the class Baden-Württemberg.
In addition, it has been said that the weight of the vessel is excessive, which means that the revenue and the capacity of the Navy are limited.
It is believed that the “Rheinland-Pfalz”, of 7,000 tons, will weigh twice as much as the German ships that were used during the Second World War.
The band of defective materials, the cost of the project, which also includes the training of the crew, is also starting to pose a problem.
It is believed that the company has received 3.100 million euros (3.600 million dollars) from a starting capital of 2.200 million euros.
The problems of the new frigates have become a special problem, if we take into account the recent warnings that indicate that the military power of the German Navy is weakening.
The German Defence Minister, Hans-Peter Bartels, has admitted that the German Navy is “without any vessels that can be used”.
The official has said that the situation has worsened with the time because they are going to stop using the old vessels, but they are not going to provide any new ones.
He lamented that the Baden-Württemberg class of ships cannot be united with the Navy.
The National Foundation spies on the secret life of the rats
A new investigation carried out in a farm in the Highlands of Scotland is trying to discover how the red squirrels use the landscape to feed themselves.
We hope that the new discoveries will bring new data about the behaviour of these flying mammals and help in future conservation activities.
The National Science and Engineering Research Council of Scotland will continue to support the study of the natural sciences and engineering in the Highlands and Islands, as well as the study of the north Atlantic and the Arctic.
They will install special recording devices in the areas of the property to monitor the activities of the rats during the season.
Volunteers and staff of the National Health Service will also carry out mobile tests with detectors.
The analysis of the sound of the recordings by experts will determine the frequency of the sounds of the rats and what each species makes.
This information will be used to create a report and a map of the habitat to create a detailed image of the landscape of the area.
Rob Dewar, conservation officer for the Scottish Natural Heritage, is hoping that the results will show that the habitats are more important for the species than the numbers of rats and rabbits.
This information will help to determine the advantages of the work of the habitat, such as the creation of green spaces, and to improve the maintenance of forests for the benefit of the animals and other associated species.
The population of rats in Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom has reduced considerably in the last century.
The construction and restoration of buildings threaten the bats, as they can cause the loss of habitat.
The wind turbines and the lighting also pose a risk, just like the paper we use for making matches and chemical treatments used in building materials, as well as the attacks by domestic cats.
In reality, the rats are not cecs.
The owls are more useful than the crows when hunting at night, because they are more active.
They use a sophisticated technique of localization to locate insects and obstacles that interfere with their flight.
The National Heritage Foundation of Scotland, responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, is taking the matter very seriously.
The experts have the appropriate training, they carry out surveys, inspections and, in some cases, rescues.
The first and only reserve in Scotland dedicated to the Scottish crossbill has been created at Threave Estate, Dumfries and Galloway, which is the stronghold of the two Scottish crossbills.
The owner of the farm, David Thompson, says that it is the ideal territory for the species.
“Here, at Threave, we have a great area for the rats”, says the manager.
“We have built houses, many trees are old and we have a good habitat.”
But they still have many aspects to improve, so the information that we have here and at other properties will help us to understand better what they need to create.
It is important to check if there have been any ratpens before carrying out maintenance work on properties, as it is possible that the possible destruction of a newborn colony of 400 females and juveniles could lead to the disappearance of the entire population.
The rats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, attack them, molest them or destroy them.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish Wildlife Trust's officer for the conservation of the Scottish wildcat, has urged the public to help.
He said the following: "We still have to learn a lot about the rats and, in the case of some of our species, we do not have any data on their population".
Ronaldo denies the accusations of rape while his lawyers prepare a lawsuit against a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has indicated that the accusations of rape against him are false and he has said that the girl "wants to become famous" thanks to his name.
The lawyers of the Catalan government will demand the German weekly Der Spiegel to withdraw the accusations published in its latest issue.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a room of a Las Vegas hotel in the year 2009.
Presumption, you will pay $375,000 because the incident is not public, in accordance with the information published on Thursday by Der Spiegel.
In a video on Instagram Live, Ronaldo, who has 142 million followers, will say that the allegations are false.
No, no, no, no, no.
The one who said today, false news,
“I want to be famous thanks to my name.”
It's normal.
I don't want to be famous, but it's part of my job.
A happy home and everything is in order”, he added, smiling.
The lawyers of Cristiano Ronaldo are preparing a lawsuit against Der Spiegel for the accusations, which they have qualified as "unacceptable information about private life", in agreement with Reuters.
The lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player will seek compensation for "moral damages for a loss of income equivalent to the gravity of the infringement, which is one of the most flagrant violations of personal rights in recent years."
The supposed incident will take place in June 2009 in a suite of the hotel and casino Palms in Las Vegas.
After learning about the incident, Ronaldo and Mayorga went back to the hotel room, where, according to the reports, Ronaldo raped Mayorga anally, according to the reports.
Mayorga says that Ronaldo is going to be fined after the alleged incident and he will tell him that we are 99% good guys, except for a "1%".
The documents support that Ronaldo will confirm that both women have sexual relations, but they will be consensual.
Mayorga also said she was going to the police and they would take pictures of the injuries at the hospital, but she would accept a later agreement outside the courts because she had "fear of reprisals" and she was worried about being "humiliated publicly".
The woman, 34 years old, says she wants to annul the agreement, because she is still traumatized by the supposed incident.
Ronaldo was about to sign for Real Madrid from Manchester United in the summer and now he has signed for Juventus, the Italian giant, for 100 million euros.
Brexit: The United Kingdom will always lose car manufacturers
The United Kingdom will always be a great place to do business, says Greg Clark, Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy.
He said it was “worrying” that the base of Toyota in Burnaston, Derbyshire, had told the BBC that, if the UK left the EU without a deal, it would have to temporarily stop production at the factory.
“We need an agreement”, Clark said.
The Japanese manufacturer has indicated that the impact of delays at the borders in the event of a Brexit without an agreement could cause job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which makes the Auris and Avensis models for Toyota, will produce 150,000 cars this year, of which 90% will be exported to the rest of Europe.
“My view is that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, it will be a disaster for our factory”, said Marvin Cooke, director of operations at Toyota Burnaston.
Get out of the EU without a deal on trade with the rest of the EU has woken up other car manufacturers in the UK, such as Honda, BMW, Jaguar and Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to the fact that the manufacturers consider risks in the supply chain in case of Brexit without an agreement.
The Toyota production line is real, in a base “just in time”, with fish arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the EU for the manufacture of cars.
If the Kingdom of Spain does not join the European Union without a referendum, it is possible that there will be disturbances at the border, which the sector considers that it could generate delays and shortages of fish.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep stocks at the Derbyshire plant for more than a day, according to the company, and production would have to be stopped.
Clark says that Theresa May’s Chequers plan for Brexit is “calibrated precisely to avoid these border controls”.
“We want to reach an agreement. We want to get the best agreement that we can, as we said, not only to enjoy the current situation, but also to take advantage of this opportunity.”
“The proofs are not only of Toyota, but also of other manufacturers, that they need to be able to continue with an exit of conjunct production”.
Toyota has not been able to confirm for how long it will be able to produce, but in the long term, it has warned that the costs associated with the investment will reduce the competitiveness of the plant and could cause the loss of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the Unite the Union coordinator at the plant, said the members were becoming increasingly concerned: “For experience, when these jobs are lost, they don’t come back.”
A government spokesman has said the following: “We have designed a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU”.
According to the White House, the meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could end up reopening
The expected meeting between Donald Trump and the US Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be postponed for a week while the struggle over the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein supervises the investigation of the special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the elections, the links between Russia and Trump and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
If Trump does not fire the special prosecutor or Mueller, he will be feeding the rumors in Washington for months.
This month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the possibility of recording Trump's conversations and also the possibility of deposing the president with the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein has denied the information.
But yesterday the rumors were that he was about to resign.
The Catalan government will announce tomorrow a meeting with Trump, who was in the United States at the time.
Trump has said he would prefer not to appoint Rosenstein, but he is postponing the meeting to avoid a confrontation with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Kavanaugh and one of the women who is going to accuse him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
Friday, Trump will order a week-long investigation by the FBI into the Kavanaugh allegations, which will end up hurting him more than the Senate vote.
The White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, will appear on Fox News Sunday.
Question about the meeting with Rosenstein, he will answer the following: "We have not yet set a date, it could be this week, or that we will have to wait another week for all the assumptions with the Supreme Court.
But I have already seen. I always like to keep informed of the press.
Some journalists could refute this assertion: Sanders has not made a press conference from the White House since September 10.
The presenter Chris Wallace is going to ask why.
Sanders will contest that the lack of sessions was because he didn’t like the journalists’ showy behavior, and that he will say: “I won’t deny that we are showy”.
Trump is not a journalist, but he is a journalist.
“The president asks more questions and gives more answers than the previous president”, he will say, before adding, without citing any sources, “I have consulted these data”.
Sanders said that the sessions would continue, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask directly to the President of the United States, it is infinitely better than talking with me."
I intend to go there, I have seen it for a long time and I will replace the sessions with informative sessions when I can talk to the President of the United States.
Trump responds to questions when he is asked about the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences or when he is on official visits.
The first-person plural pronoun is rare.
This week, the president of the United States has demonstrated why, after a brief appearance and, in some moments, a little distant from the journalists gathered.
The Secretary of Health of the EU wrote to the workers of the National Health Service of Scotland about the fears of the Scots over Brexit
The Secretary of Health of Scotland has written to the staff of the EU who work in the Scottish Health Service to express gratitude for the country and to ask that it continues after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, member of the Scottish Parliament, will send a letter to the UK Government in the next six months.
The Scottish government has agreed to cover the cost of the applications of EU citizens working in public services.
According to his letter, Freeman will write the following: "During the summer, the negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on the exit have continued, and it seems to be heading towards the decisions expected at this late hour."
However, the government of the United Kingdom has also started preparations in case of a possible scenario without an agreement.
I know that these are difficult times for all of you.
For that, I would like to reiterate that I appreciate very much the contribution of all the staff, regardless of their nationality.
The companies of the EU, and of course, more in the future, will bring a valuable experience and resources that will strengthen and improve the service of the health system, while benefiting patients and communities that we serve.
For the discount, Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here.
Christian Abercrombie was taken to hospital after suffering a head injury
Christian Abercrombie, the Tennessee State Tigers' starting quarterback, has been ruled out for the remainder of the season after suffering a knee injury in the team's 31-27 loss to Vanderbilt on Saturday, according to Mike Organ, of the Tennessean.
The coach of Tennessee State, Rod Reed, has told the press that the injury will be produced before the middle of the season.
“He’s going to come to the line of scrimmage and he’s going to fall over there,” Reed said.
The coaches and medical staff will give oxygen to Abercrombie before placing him in a litter and moving him to a hospital to be treated.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris, of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been released from the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris said that "there is still no information about the type or the amount of the injury" and Tennessee State is investigating when the injury will be produced.
It's the first season of Abercrombie, from second year, after coming from Illinois.
There were five places to be filled on Saturday before the abandonment of the party, which in total has 18 this season.
The foreigners have to pay a higher stamp duty when buying a property in the UK
The foreigners have to pay a higher stamp duty when buying a property in the United Kingdom with the additional costs used to help people without a home according to our plans.
This action will neutralize the exit of the Corbyn movement for young voters.
The increase in the stamp duty will be charged on those persons who do not pay stamp duty to the Kingdom.
The government expects to obtain 120 million euros a year to help people without a job.
We hope that the tax on foreign buyers will be increased to a higher level in order to help people who cannot afford to buy a property in the UK and that these measures will be announced by Theresa May today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize the exit of Jeremy Corbyn from the votes of young people with promises of providing more affordable housing that would affect the rents more.
The increase in the stamp duty will be levied on those persons and companies who do not pay taxes in the Kingdom; these revenues will be used to combat tax evasion.
The surcharge, which will be added to the current stamp duty, will be 3% for the highest value properties and 2% for the second highest value properties. 
The Catalan government expects to obtain 120 million euros annually.
It was estimated that 13% of new buildings in London are owned by non-British residents, which increases the prices and makes it difficult for new buyers to open up the scale of properties.
Many areas of the country, especially the capital, have become "ghost cities" because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new measure above all next week when Boris Johnson has asked for a reduction in the stamp duty for first-time buyers to help them buy their first home.
You will accuse the big construction companies of maintaining the high prices of the land, and not using it, and you will ask May to annul the quotes over the affordable prices for the land, to correct the “immobiliari disaster” of Great Britain.
Corbyn has announced a series of attractive reforms to the housing market, including controls on rents and the finalization of the “without fault” procedure.
Also, the municipalities can build new buildings.
I have just said that I will dedicate my mandate to restoring the British sleep: life must get better for the next generation.
I want to correct the immovable property market, which is too narrow.
The Great Britain will always be open to all who want to live, work and create a life here.
I think it is not correct that we are the same for people who do not see the United Kingdom, as well as for businesses with their foreign, buy housing in comparison with British residents who work.
For the majority of people, the dream of having a house of their own is still far away and the indignity of those without a house is still very real.
Jack Ross: “My maximum ambition is to coach Scotland”
The Sunderland manager, Jack Ross, has said that his "maximum ambition" is to be the manager of Scotland at some point.
The Scottish, 42 years old, has accepted the resignation of the manager of the north-east club, which currently occupies the third position in the League One, three points from the leader.
We will be back at the Stadium of Light this summer after returning to the Scottish Premiership last season.
“I want to play for my country when I was a player.
I’m going to try and get a game in the next week or so, and that’s what I’m going to try and do.
“But I have grown up playing in Hampden with my father when I was a child and it is always a thing that makes me go back in time.”
This opportunity will only come to me if I have a contract with a club, but I don't have one yet.
The predecessors of Ross in the Sunderland job include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paolo Di Canio.
The manager of Alloa Athletic says he is not feeling the pressure of being the next in a list of names to be consecrated in a team as big as this, after having previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“At the moment, my criteria for measuring my exit will be whether I can get the Premier League team back to the top.”
The structure and the stadium of the club, it is obvious that its place is in the Premier League.
“It’s not easy to arrive here, but I only think about coming back if I can play.”
Ross has only three years of experience as a coach, after a period with a second coach at Dumbarton and 15 months with the technical director of Hearts.
You will help the Alloa to avoid the descent to the third category and you will transform the St Mirren to champions of the Championship the next season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable in the Scottish league than he did in the English league.
“It’s probably going to be a decisive moment,” he said about accepting the offer from Alloa.
“I always thought that training was the most important thing, more than playing.”
I'm sorry I had to leave because I had to go out, I had a good time and I'm glad I went out.
But playing can be very hard.
There are many things you have to overcome each week.
I am feeling the pressure and the stress of the situation, but I feel good as a coach.
I have always wanted to train and I have always been doing it, and this time I feel more comfortable than ever before.

The perfect time for a pint is 5:30 on a Saturday, according to a study
The heat wave of summer has disappeared in the bars of Great Britain, but has added more pressure to the chains of restaurants.
The bars and restaurants have obtained an increase of 2.7% in sales in July, but the consumption in restaurants has reduced by 4.8%, according to the statistics.
Peter Martin, the financial advisor of CGA, the company that has collected the data, said the following: "The continuous hours of sun and the participation of England in the World Cup, which has expanded more than expected, have made the July figures similar to those of June, with an increase of 2.8% in bars, except in the case of restaurants, which have suffered more.
The reduction of 1.8% in the consumption of restaurants in June has increased in July.
The bars and taverns, leaders in the consumption of begudes, have obtained the best results, while the consumption of restaurants has been at a low.
The bars that offer food have also suffered from the sun, all and that it has not been so dramatic as in the case of the restaurants.
It seems that the people only want to go out and have fun.
The bars and taverns that we have consulted, the sales of houses have increased by 6.6% during the month, while the sales of food have decreased by 3%”.
Paul Newman, from the analysts of the hotel and catering industry RSM, has said the following: "These results continue the trend that we have seen since the end of April."
The time and the impact of great social events or sporting competitions continue to be the main factors related to the sales of olive oil.
It is not surprising that restaurants continue to have problems, but a decrease of 4.8% in sales in a year would be particularly harmful, more than the continuous pressure on costs.
This summer was so long and hot that we could not have arrived at a better time for the markets to serve and eat and the weather will tell us if the temperatures are more moderate than we had in August.
The total increase in the sales of bars and restaurants, including the recent ones, has been 2.7% in July, as indicated by the increase in the number of brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker for restaurants, bars and taverns in the UK, which measures sales and profit performance of 47 operators, with a combined turnover of more than £9 million and is the benchmark for the sector.
One in every five children have secret accounts in social networks that they use to blackmail their peers
One in every five children, some aged 11, have accounts with social networks that threaten their parents, according to data from a survey
A survey among 20,000 secondary school students has indicated an increase in the number of fake Instagram accounts
The news have created the fears about the publication of sexual content
20% of students say they have a “main” account that they show to their peers
One out of every five children, some as young as 11, believe that social networks are a threat to adults.
A survey among 20,000 secondary school students has indicated a rapid increase in the number of false accounts on Instagram, a reference to the photo-sharing site.
The news have created the fears about the publication of sexual content.
20% of the students say they have a “main” account that they show to their friends, while they also have a “private” account.
A girl who is going to discover the secret account of her 13-year-old daughter will see a message from another girl who wants to “rape me”.
The research, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Committee of Directors of Independent Schools (HMC) of independent schools, has revealed that 40% of 11-18 year olds have two profiles, of which the majority have private accounts.
The head of the HMC, Mike Buchanan, has said: “It is worrying that many young people are tempted to create spaces in cyberspace with their peers and teachers cannot find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the “voice of the athletes” at the Scottish Athletics Federation
Eilidh Doyle has been named the new Director of the Scottish Athletics Federation at the Annual General Meeting.
Doyle is the athlete of the year in Scotland and the track and field and president Ian Beattie will describe the movement as a great opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from his international experience in the last decade.
“The respect of the community of athletics in Scotland, the United Kingdom and the whole world, we are sure that the Scottish athletics will benefit from the incorporation of the Scottish Athletics to the board”, he said.
Doyle has said the following: "I have many ambitions to act as a volunteer for the athletes and I hope to be able to help the sport and contribute to Scotland."
The United States, which will be hosting the 200 and 400 meters in the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, will be deprived of four Olympic gold medals and currently is a regular commentator for the BBC, will be prevented from walking after suffering a transient ischemic attack.
I will write the following on Twitter: “I had a stroke a month ago.
He couldn't walk.
The doctors say that only time will tell if I can recover or not.
I've been exhausted, but I've recovered all of it, I'm going to do exercises of agility today!
Thank you for the messages of support!
An ad about bulls and cows that compares the two breeds and divides opinion on the Internet
A dairy company has divided the opinion on the Internet with an ad that compares the milk of cows with that of goats.
To mark the launch of the “first silent tirallet that can be carried by the world”, the consumer technology company Elvie has released an ad inspired by a music video for a joke about the freedom that the new tirallet gives to women.
Four mares are grazing in a large field, and a herd of cows and calves are walking to the rhythm of a song that includes the words: "Yes, I love my little one, but you won't see her again."
The storm continues: “Bombeja, bombeja, feed the fish, bombeja, bombeja, feed the fish”.
The announcement, published on the Facebook page of the company, caused controversy on the Internet.
The video has been viewed 77,000 times and has received 1000 comments, most of which are positive, with many saying that it shows the horrors of the dairy industry.
“It is a bad decision to use the word ‘vague’ to announce the product.”
With us, they have to be embarrassed and give birth to produce, with the difference that they are separated from their children's little days after giving birth.
The Elvie is hidden in a discreet lactation support (Elvie/Mother)
Another person is going to comment on the following: “Comprehensible that the mare and the swimmer.
But why not use them to announce a sale of a house that has its own pool?
Another user can add: “This is an ad outside the site”.
Other people defend the announcement; one woman admits that she found the song "funny".
“I think it’s a great idea.”
I will buy one if I still have to give a breast.
The cow is feeling very well, as if she were a cow.
The announcement is a bit of a joke, but we have to take it as it is.
It’s a great product”, writes a user.
Another person is going to comment the following: “It’s a funny ad aimed at people who work in offices and who are bored with the usual stuff (usually at work or in the toilet and feel like they’re going to faint).
It is not the judge who decides that the industry is in Catalonia.
At the end of the video, the girls show that they have danced all together with the tirallet discreetly.
The concept that is behind the campaign is based on the perception that many people feel like they are cows when they use the tirallet.
The Elvie is completely silent, it doesn't have a cable or tube and it fits discreetly in a lactation support, which gives women more freedom to move around, breastfeed and, finally, go out while breastfeeding.
Ana Balarin, Mother’s first-time mom developer, said: “The Elvie Tirallet is a revolutionary product that deserves a daring and provocative campaign.
In order to show the parallelism between women and cows, we want to show to the public how useful a tirallet and the related tools are, at the moment we demonstrate, in a funny and instructive way, the incredible feeling of freedom that the new tirallet offers.
It is not the first time that Elvie has caused a stir in the news.
During the London Fashion Week, two girls will appear in the designer's collection as models.
Hundreds of children, silently transported to a camp on the Texas border
The name of children emigrants has increased even though the monthly entries through the border have remained almost stable, in part because the harsh rhetoric and the political measures introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to adopt children.
Traditionally, most godparents are immigrants without papers, who have taken the risk of staying in the country if they decide to have a child.
The risk has increased in June, when the federal authorities announced that the possible sponsors and the rest of the adults who have adopted children will have to send digital certificates, which will be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, will testify before the House Judiciary Committee that ICE agents arrested dozens of people who had sought to bring unaccompanied minors into the country.
The agency will confirm later that 70% of the arrests had no criminal record.
“The majority of the people who have been in the square are not Catalans, but they are foreigners who are criminals.”
As such, they will continue to persecute these people”, said Albence.
To process the children more quickly, the officials have introduced new rules that require that some have to present themselves at the office within a month after being notified, instead of 60 days, which was the standard before, in agreement with workers of the refugee camps.
Many of them will appear by videoconference, instead of in person, to defend their case before a judge to obtain the legal status of immigrants.
Those who are not considered fit for help will be deported immediately.
With more time spent with children, it is more likely that they will suffer from anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outbursts or attempts to run away, according to the workers and the reports that have been made in the last few months.
The lawyers say that these concerns can intensify in larger installations, such as Tornillo, where the child is more likely to be passing through the signs that indicate that a child is not ill.
He added that moving the children to the camp without giving them time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to their friends could cause them trauma that they are already suffering from.
Syria calls on the occupying forces of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
The Syrian government will ask the UN General Assembly to help Syrian refugees return home, despite the war that has been raging in the country for eight years.
Muallem, who also acted as vice-prime minister, has said that foreign forces and terrorists are operating in Syrian territory illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and "we will deal with it accordingly".
“They must be removed immediately and without conditions,” he said.
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem said that the “war on terror” in Syria is almost over, and that more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have been displaced.
He said that Damascus will continue to fight this sacred battle until it has cleansed all of Syrian territory of all terrorist groups and of any foreign presence, illegal or otherwise.
The United States have 2000 troops in Syria, mainly to form and advise the Kurdish and Arab Syrian rebels who are fighting against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1000 tropes on its territory, which was bombed during the war.
On the refugee situation, Muallem said that the conditions were good for their return and he blamed "some Western countries" for not allowing them to return "irrationally" and that they should be allowed to stay.
“We are calling on the international community and human rights organizations to facilitate these returns,”
“They are trying to make it look like a humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no aid to Syria until Assad and the opposition reach a political agreement.
The diplomatic representatives of the United Nations have stated that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a neutral zone in Idlib, the last bastion of the rebels, has favored the opportunity to continue the political negotiations.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented a large-scale attack on Syrian forces with the help of Russia in the province, there are three million people.
The Catalan government has said that the agreement has "clear terms" and has expressed the hope that the military action will put an end to the jihadists, who include combatants from the Al-Nusra Front, which is linked to Al-Qaeda, which will be eradicated.
Staffan de Mistura, sent by the UN, is waiting to convene the first meetings of a new committee to be formed by the government and the opposition to start drafting a new constitution and prepare the way for elections.
Muallem will present the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, the pocket of which will have to be restricted to "review the articles of the current constitution" and will warn of possible interferences.
Why Trump will win again
According to this logic, Trump would win the 2020 elections, just like he did in 2016, and, as many liberals probably hope, the impeachment and the trial would end with his removal from office.
The one who would be, doubtfully, “the end of a presidency more dramatic than the history”.
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue in the audience.
From 2014, the number of viewers in the prime time of maximum audience has more than doubled from 1.05 million to 2.1 million, and almost tripled from 1.6 million to 4.5 million.
Fox News has a 2.4 million viewers in the prime time, from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and “The Rachel Maddow Show”, from the MSNBC, has led the cable news ratings with more than 3.5 million viewers in the prime time.
“The people have seen it coming because they have been watching it”, Neal Baer, executive producer of the ABC series “Designated Survivor”, about a secretary of the cabinet who becomes president when a terrorist attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club”, has another theory.
Remember a trip to Boston before the 2016 elections.
The taxi driver will tell you that he will vote for Trump.
“Why?”, he will ask.
“He will answer that because he was laughing”, he will say Scovell.
There is a point of entertainment in the chaos.
The difference between the programs of the TV, the guide that comes from Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, if the families of immigrants can reunite and the state of the world economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
I think that if I were a city, I would be a city that is not a city and more than a city when I see that at 3:00 in the morning, a group of experts are debating the use that Bob Woodward has made of the word “for private use” in his book “Fear”, the jacket of 15,000 dollars of Paul Manafort (“a piece of junk cloth”, says the Washington Post) and the consequences of the descriptions that Stormy Daniels is going to make of the anatomy of Trump.
In my house, I will never see Super Mario again.
“Part of what makes it seem like we’re part of a reality TV program is that each night we give something new,” says Brent Montgomery, executive producer of “Pawn Stars” and creator of “Pawn Stars” about the changes in the cast and the girls in the show’s script. “We’re going to be talking to Kim Jong-Un.”
No one can lose their cap episode because they are all connected.
I was able to see Fleiss this past week, and it was 25 degrees and sunny, and it was a beautiful day. I was able to see the MSNBC while recording the CNN.
Couldn't be disentangled, not with Brett Kavanaugh in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
“I remember that when I was a child, I saw those programs and the people who were there were the beginning of the end of the western civilization”, Fleiss said.
“I thought it was a joke, but it seems they have a point.”

The external dinners in the evening are not suitable for the elections of the Chamber of Representatives in the middle of the legislative term
It is not surprising that there has been a flood of diners in the 17th district of Pennsylvania, thanks to the realignment of congressional districts that has made two members currently competing for the same place.
This reassignment of the suburban Pittsburgh district recently assigned to Democrat Conor Lamb, who will take the place in another district after special elections last spring.
Lamb faced off against another representative, Keith Rothfus, who represents the 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is in conflict with the new 17th district.
The maps must be redrawn after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania rules that the 9th district is unconstitutional in favor of the Republicans.
The race for the 17th district has triggered a financial war between the main financial organizations of the parties, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC).
Lamb is going to make a name for himself in Pennsylvania after winning a special election in a congressional district that is very closely divided.
The Republicans have occupied the White House for more than a decade and President Donald Trump is going to give the district 20 points of difference.
The political experts give the democrats an unfair advantage.
The United States impose sanctions on the Salvadoran government for its support of the Xinca, but they will not withdraw
The diplomatic community has already observed that the Dominican Republic and Panama have recognized the People's Republic of China, with little response from Washington.
Trump will maintain a tense meeting with the president of Panama, Juan Carlos Valera, in June 2017 and his hotel in Panama City will be managed by the Trump Organization.
The Department of State will decide to withdraw the diplomatic missions of the United States in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to recent decisions on the recognition of Taiwan, said Heather Nauert, spokesperson of the department, this month.
The only thing that we can do is to observe the possibility of sanctioning El Salvador, which is going to receive $140 million of aid from the United States this year, according to the estimates, for the control of drug trafficking, development and better economic conditions.
The sanctions proposed, which include restrictions on financial aid and restrictions on visas, are harmful to the country and will increase the number of deaths by murder and assassination.
With the internal meetings, official of both countries are postponing a high level meeting focused on security and economic prosperity. This is similar to the meeting held last year and will continue with the same agenda as last year. This is a step forward to prevent the emigrants from going to the United States.
But in September, officials of high rank in the administration will clarify that they want the meeting to be held, and that it will end with a definitive decision, with a high probability of sanction for Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence has been selected to lead the U.S. delegation to the October 2018 meeting, a signal of the importance the administration places on the issue, according to U.S. officials.
The three Americans who were released quietly as their cars from the Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any harsh messages or sanctions from Washington.
A White House official said Bolton will not be able to discuss the details of the debate that will be held with the three officials, which will include two diplomats, who will discuss internal deliberations from the anonymity.
An external analyst, who is also anonymous, will corroborate the declarations.
Study history
The proper event in producing the information could be the special counsel Robert Mueller's report on possible obstruction of justice, of which there are many public records.
The Mueller investigation also looks into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia in the 2016 election.
If the Congress changes the law, Trump could be prosecuted by the organization, just as soon as he is prepared to do so before the voters, and, finally, before a jury of members of the party.
There are many circumstantial conditions, and I do not want to suggest that the fall of Trump, or of his European counterparts, is inevitable.
There are decisions that have to be taken by all the countries of the Atlantic that will affect how long this situation will last.
In 1938, the German officials were ready to make a coup against Hitler, only if the western bloc had resisted and had given support to the Czechs.
If you break it, you buy it.
The course of history fluctuates over points of inflection, and this and that, and it accelerates or slows down the inexorable progress of democracy.
The United States of America is currently facing various points of inflexion.
What will happen if Trump fires Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, the man who controls the Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein has been with the water since the day this newspaper will inform that, last year, he will suggest secretly recording the president and will speculate that it was not appropriate for the pain.
Rosenstein says the Times information is not correct.
“If the new investigation that the FBI has requested on Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if it confirms the allegations of sexual abuse and false testimony, what will you do?”
I, especially, will vote for the next Congress to make Trump responsible
If I don't succeed in proving these points, democracy will start to run out of steam.
But I think they won't break, because I've already learned the language in Prague.
My mother was a young Czech deported to Auschwitz by the same regime that is going to occupy the house of the ambassador.
You will survive, you will emigrate to the United States and, 60 years later, you will send a torch to burn the tablecloth with the cross on it.

Graham Dorrans, from Rangers, optimistic about the match against Rapid Vienna
The Rangers beat Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a victory against the Austrians would put them in a good position to qualify for the group stage of the Europa League.
A knee injury to Graham Dorrans will prevent him from playing the first 2 minutes of the season, but he believes that Rangers can use this result as a springboard for great results.
“It will be a positive point for us, because Vila-real is a good team”, he said.
“We’ll play the game to see if we can get a good result and then we’ll leave with a point.”
Maybe we could have something more at the end, but, in general, probably the empathy will be a result.
They will be better than us in the first part, but they will be better than us in the second.
On Thursday, it is another great European night.
We hope to stay with the three points, but it will be a difficult game because they will want to get a good result in the last game, but I am sure that we will give everything and get a good result with the support of the fans.
Last year was really hard, with the injuries I suffered and the changes at the club, but here is a good place to be.
The team is good and we are happy, the trainings are good.
I hope they can get it done, leave it behind and move on.
The women lose their voice because the state is not interested in the future
Most of the participants in the survey had a clear idea of what they wanted to do, few people spoke about it with their family.
Most of the national surveys say that they have spoken with their partner about long-term care.
Only 10% of the respondents say they have spoken to their children.
“People want to take care of their loved ones, but they don’t want to plan for it,” says Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
Let's start here.
Speak with your wife and your children: you can't prepare your family because you don't communicate your wishes in advance.
Work with your advisor and your family to decide on and complete your assessment, as these decisions can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Include your financial advisor in the conversation: we can also help you determine how to pay these expenses.
Your options for financing your long-term care needs may include a long-term care insurance policy that can help cover the cost of traditional long-term care, a hybrid life insurance policy that can help cover the cost of long-term care expenses, or a policy of your own with the income you have available to pay for it.
Prepare your legal documents: sign the battlefields.
Find a representative to be able to designate a person of confidence to supervise your medical care and ensure that the professionals complete your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
Also consider the possibility of contracting a notary for your finances.
Select a person of trust to take financial decisions for you and guarantee that your bills are paid in case of incapacity.
Don't worry about the small details: Imagine that your family member has an emergency medical situation and is on the way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Please specify these details in a written statement.
The finances are not the only factor that will determine, but also the doctors who will treat them", said Martin.
Quins are the medicines?
Who will take care of the goose?

Tsunamis and Terratrèmols in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died in the aftermath of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Thursday, according to the country’s disaster agency. It is feared the death toll will rise.
As the communications are still down, the units of assistance have not been able to obtain information from the regency of Donggala, a region closer to the epicenter of the earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
The Palu, s”han evacuated more than 16.000 people after the disaster.
Below are some important information about Palu and Donggala, the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Celebes, located at the extreme west of the narrow coastal strip of the island of Celebes, with an estimated population of 379,800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit.
Donggala is a regency that is located more than 300 km from the north-west coast of the island of Celebes.
The region, a lower administrative region, had a population of 299,200 people in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of the province of Central Celebes, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
The exploitation of nickel mines is also important in the province, but concentrates, mainly, in Morowali, on the other side of Celebes.
The Palu and Donggala area have been hit by various tsunamis in the last 100 years, in accordance with the Indonesian disaster mitigation agency.
In 1938, a tsunami will kill more than 200 people and destroy hundreds of houses in Donggala.
The year 1996 will also produce a tsunami in the west of Donggala that will kill us.
Indonesia is found the belt of the Pacific and it is going to produce terratrèmols with certain frequency.
Following are the main terratrèmols and tsunamis of the last years:
2004: On December 26, a great earthquake of 9.1 magnitude on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh, north of Sumatra, will cause a tsunami that will affect 14 countries and kill 226,000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean, most of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes will affect the western coast of Sumatra at the end of March and the beginning of April.
Many people die on the island of Nias, the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake will strike the southern tip of Java, the most populated island in Indonesia, and will cause a tsunami that will destroy the southern coast and kill almost 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people have died.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake will strike the Mentawai Islands, off the coast of Sumatra, and will cause a tsunami of up to 10 metres that will destroy dozens of villages and kill hundreds of people.
2016: A strong earthquake will hit Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh and will cause destruction and panic, as the population will remember the devastation of the earthquake and the deadly tsunami of 2004.
This time, no tsunami will be produced, but more than 100 people will die because of the buildings that will collapse.
2018: A series of great landslides will occur in the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mainly in the north of the island.
The demolition will destroy thousands of buildings and leave thousands of tourists trapped temporarily.
The big son of Sarah Palin arrested with domestic violence
Track Palin, the son of the former governor of Alaska and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested for assault.
Palin, 29 years old, from Wasilla, Alaska, will be arrested for domestic violence, interference with a police report and resisting arrest, according to a public report released Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a known person tries to trick the police to report a crime, they will stretch the phone.
Palin is being held at the Mat-Su Pretrial Detention Center, where she is being held without bail on a charge of driving under the influence.
You will be tried in court on Saturday, when you will be declared "not guilty, with security" when you will be asked what you were declaring, according to this channel.
Palin committed three Class A misdemeanors, which means she could be sentenced to a year in jail and have to pay a fine of up to $250,000.
He was also accused of a lack of class B, which can be punished with a day in prison and a fine of 2,000 USD.
It is not the first time that Palin is registered for criminal charges.
In December 2017, Todd Palin will be accused of assaulting his father.
Sarah Palin, the mayor of Wasilla, will be tricking the police to notify the presumptive attack.
Currently, the case is before the veterans court of Alaska.
In 2016, the man will be accused of domestic violence, interference with the information of a domestic violence case and possession of a weapon in a state of drunkenness in relation to the incident.
His wife will declare that she had given him a slap in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin will be criticized by veterans groups for associating the violent behavior of her son with a post-traumatic stress disorder resulting from his service in Iraq.
Terratrèmol and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
384 people have died after a landslide on the Indonesian island of Celebes on Thursday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake has caused a tsunami and has destroyed millions of dollars.
The electricity and the communication networks are not working and we expect the number of deaths to increase over the coming days.
The earthquake occurred in the coastal area of Central Sulawesi, Indonesia, near the capital city of Jakarta.
The social networks are circulating videos of the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people have gathered on the beach in the city of Palu to celebrate the festival of the centenary of the city.
Federal fiscal authorities demand an exceptional penalty for the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York
The federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the terror attack in New York that killed eight people: a death penalty that has not been applied to the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, is believed to have used a Home Depot truck to carry out the attack on a bike path in the West Side Highway, Lower Manhattan and cyclists during his route, in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors have to prove that Saipov intends to kill the eight victims "intentionally" and that "intentionally" will cause severe physical harm, in accordance with the district attorney's request to seek the death penalty.
The crimes of the accused could be punished with death, according to the document of the court.
After the attack, a grand jury federal is going to attack Saipov with a written accusation with 22 charges that included 8 counts of murder in the benefit of a criminal organization, which federal prosecutors can use in mafia cases, in addition to a charge of violence and destruction of vehicles.
The fiscal office has said that the attack will require "considerable planning and premeditation" and will describe the way Saipov acted as "inhumane, cruel and depraved".
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused the deaths, injuries and pain of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco, according to the official statement.
The victims were all Argentinian tourists.
It has been a decade since the last execution in the southern district of New York.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, will be sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of two drug dealers, but will be sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a federal death sentence was carried out in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Ambdós Rosenbergs died in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to the documents of the court, Saipov, who was born in Uzbekistan, will not show remorse in the days and months following the attack.
The police will say that they will confirm to the investigators that they felt bad for what they had done.
In agreement with the indictment, Saipov will explain to the authorities that he was inspired by watching ISIS videos on his phone before carrying out the attack.
According to the police, they will also ask that the flag of ISIS be displayed in the room of the hospital.
He has been found guilty of 22 offences.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders who represented Saipov, will say that it is "obviously" wrong to have decided to charge him.
“We consider that the decision to ask for the death penalty, in lieu of accepting a declaration of guilt and a life sentence without possibility of parole, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all those involved,” Patton said.
The defense of Saipov had asked for a prior warning to the fiscal authorities that they should not ask for the death penalty.
A member of the Conservative Party in the UK parliament says Nigel Farage will be asked to resign if he is involved in Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage is going to promise "to mobilise the popular tropes" today during a protest against the Conservative Party conference.
The leader of the UKIP has said that the politicians have to "feel the pressure of the Eurosceptics" when one of the members of the UK parliament of Theresa May has suggested that he would lead the negotiations with the EU.
The Conservative MP Peter Bone will tell the people of Birmingham that the UK would be out of the EU if the gentleman Farage was the Secretary of Brexit.
However, the challenge facing the lady May at this hour to reconcile the deep divisions in her party has been highlighted when the conservatives who are in favour of the union have presented a protest in London against the Brexit.
The first minister is fighting to keep her Chequers plan to maintain the UK’s membership of the EU intact, between the attacks of the Brexit party, the pro-EU parties and the EU.
The Catalan government insists that it will reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the negative responses and the pressure from the Eurosceptics and the conservative party to choose between the package and the chaos.
The Lord Bone will tell the meeting in Solihull that he wants to deliver the Chequers compromise.
You will suggest that Lord Farage has been appointed a member of the House of Lords and that he has been given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
If I had been in the car, I would have been out.
The member of the Wellingborough parliament will add: "I will defend Brexit, but we must implement the Chequers agreement".
To be precise, to oppose the EU, we will add: "We will not fight world wars to be slaves.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
The Lord Bone will not take into account the suggestions that the public opinion has been canvied since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British population has canvied its mental attitude and wants to leave is completely false".
The conservative party of Brexit Andrea Jenkyns will also be present at the march and will say: "Only the prime minister can decide".
The Chequers deal is unpopular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular with our party and our activists, who are the people who support the street and advise us to hold elections.
Abandoned the Chequers compromise and started to escort.
In a letter directed to Mrs May, you will add: "The first ministers maintain their position when they maintain their promises".
The Lord Farage will say that the politicians of the meeting have to feel the pressure if they want to bring the decision to the referendum in 2016.
“This, I think, is a question of confidence between us (the people) and our political class”, he will say.
“They are trying to break the Brexit and we are here to tell them that we will not allow it.”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he will add: "I will not let the political class, at the expense of Brexit, betray the people."
We are mobilizing the popular tropes of this country that will give us victory with the Brexit and we will not rest until we become an independent, autonomous and proud Kingdom.
The Catalan parties will be meeting in Birmingham before the two-hour meeting at the centre of the city.
A small number of activists were waving banners against the conservatives after the launch of the group last week.
The conservative member of the Lords Lord Adonis is going to resign from the conservative party because of the security problems that the party is facing.
These are the people who tell us that they can have the systems of IT and all the technology to have an agreement with Canada plus more, for the border without friction, for free trade with Ireland without borders.
It's a complete farce.
There is no option for a Brexit without a Catalan referendum
Warren has said she is considering running for president
The US Senator from Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren, said she will examine the possibility of running for president after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that Saturday, the Massachusetts Democrat will speak about her future at an open meeting in the western part of Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against the Republican candidate for the state of Massachusetts, Geoff Diehl, who was the running mate of Trump's 2016 campaign.
It has been speculated that Trump will run for president in 2020.
The event of Saturday, December 30th at Holyoke will be the 36th meeting with constituents with an open format or meeting of the kind that Trump will assume the presidency.
A Catalan assistant will ask if she had planned to present herself as a candidate for the presidency.
Warren will respond that it is time that "the vagina of Washington repairs our government that does not work, and that includes a woman in the top tier."
A person arrested for the murder of three people in Sims, from LSU
The Baton Rouge Police Department will announce Saturday that a suspect has been arrested in the death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
The Baton Rouge Police Department has announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, at the press conference at 11:00.
Publish a video of the shooting on Thursday and ask for help to identify the shooter.

Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton wins the title of the world after the orders of the team gave him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment when Valtteri Bottas will be ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it will be clear that the orders of the Mercedes team have a big impact on the race.
From pole position, Bottas will hold a good start and almost exhaust Hamilton while defending his position on the first two turns and inviting Vettel to attack his company.
Vettel will enter the box before Hamilton and will let him pass on the back straight, which would have been decisive.
Later, Mercedes will have to stop at the pits and will come out behind Vettel, but Hamilton will advance ahead of Vettel after a move on the inside that will cause the Ferrari driver to run off the track and risk being out after a double move.
Max Verstappen will start the last row of the grid and will finish the first lap in the last position of the race.
After that, he will continue in good position for the rest of the race, as he will keep his tyres in good condition, overtake Kimi Raikkonen and pass him to the fourth position.
Finally, he will enter the boxes at number 44, but he will not be able to increase the rhythm at the next eight laps and Raikkonen will be in fourth position.
It's a difficult day, because Valtteri will do a fantastic job throughout the whole week and will be a real gentleman who deserves to be praised.
The team has done a fantastic job today to keep a one-stop strategy
His body language will be terrible
President Donald Trump is going to rip into Senator Dianne Feinstein at a Saturday meeting for insisting on not releasing the letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
In a meeting with Virginia Western, the president is not going to talk directly about the testimony of Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but he will comment that the testimony of the person who was present at the Senate demonstrated that people are "cruel, lying and mendacious".
“One thing that could pass through the most beautiful of what is passing through the Senate, when you see anger, when you see pain, cruelty and liar.”
When you read the messages and the filters and you say "No, I wasn't there"
No he estat jo.
I've heard
Dianne Feinstein, do you want to filter?
I've read your response... Do you want to filter the document?
No, no.
I can't filter it.
I'm sorry, I'll wait a minute.
I'm sorry, but I can't filter... No, no I can't filter.", she added while imitating the senator.
Feinstein will re-release the letter detailing Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh in July and will deny that the leak came from her office.
I did not expect the doctor's testimony, I did not expect her story,
“I will ask for confidentiality and I will keep confidential, as I will ask for.”
But the President's denial won't please the Catalan people, who will be told at the meeting on Saturday night: "You know what? Your body language is going to be terrible."
Maybe I won't do it, but I think it's the best language I've ever seen.
Continuing with his defense of the candidate to the Supreme Court, accused of sexual misconduct with three women, the president will suggest that the Democrats are using the statements with their own purpose.
They have decided to use the necessary means.
I want to be the victim, the cruelty, it does not matter to who does harm, who have to run over to keep power and control.

A controller saved hundreds of passengers from a plane crash
A controller from Indonesia has become a hero after he died to ensure that a plane with 100 passengers landed safely.
More than 800 people have died and many have disappeared after a great earthquake struck the island of Celebes on Thursday and triggered a tsunami.
Many replicas have been produced in the area and there are many people trapped in the city of Palu.
However, despite the fact that his companions were able to escape by saving their lives, Anthonius Gunawan Agung, 21 years old, will not leave his post at the tremulous tower of control at the airport of Palu Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
It will be left at its place to ensure that the Batik 6321, which was on the runway at that moment, can take off safely.
After that, I thought I was going to die.
You will die later in the hospital.
An Air Navigation representative, Yohannes Sirait, is going to say that this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to ABC News.
Prepare a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to take it to a bigger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, the helicopter lost yesterday morning before it arrived at Palu.
This has broken our heart, but we will continue.
The authorities are afraid that the number of deaths could reach thousands, while the disaster mitigation agency has said that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“We are still waiting for the number of deaths to increase because there are still many people under the rubble and we still cannot reach them,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency.
The ones, with a height of about six meters, have devastated Palu, which will celebrate a common funeral on Sunday.
The armed forces and some commercial aircraft are providing assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old woman, will explain to Sky News: "Every minute, an ambulance carries a corpse."
The drinkable water is scarce.
All the little cats have been stolen.
Jan Gelfand, director of the Red Cross International in Indonesia, will explain to CNN: "The Red Cross Indonesia is working against the flood to help the survivors, but we don't know what they will find."
This is a tragedy, but it could still be saved.
The President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, will arrive in Palu on Sunday and will tell the armed forces: "We need you to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation."
Are you ready?", you can tell CNN.
Indonesia will suffer another major earthquake this year, and more than 550 people will die.
Air Niugini plane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini plane disappears after crash
The airline that operated the flight that is going to crash in a lake in Micronesia has disappeared with 47 passengers and the crew, and they say that the plane has already sunk.
Air Niugini will issue a statement that, from Saturday afternoon, they have no passenger.
The aerolínia is going to affirm that it is working with the local authorities, the hospitals and the researchers to find it.
The airline will respond immediately to the details of the requests for additional information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats help rescue other passengers and crew when the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at the Chuuk International Airport.
The Catalan authorities will be able to communicate on Thursday that 12 people have been transferred to a hospital.
The airline says that there were six passengers on board and that all are in good health.
The motive of the accident and the exact sequence of events are still unknown.
The US Navy and the US Air Force have both confirmed that the aircraft will land on the runway because the runway will be too short.
Some people think that the plane will pass the runway.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes will explain that the plane was going down.
“This is going to be extremely positive,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes will say that they should walk with water around their waists until the emergency exits are opened, which the plane was already sinking.
You'll see that the auxiliary verbs will be frightened and will start to cry, and that he will suffer a wound on his head.
The US Navy will say that the sailors who were working on the ship were also helping in the rescue by using an inflatable boat to transport the people affected to land before the ship sank.
The data from the Aviation Safety Network indicates that 111 people have died in accidents involving PNG airlines, but Air Niugini was not involved in any of these accidents.
An analyst composed a chronology of the night that is going to burn a woman alive
The prosecutor will close the case on Saturday in the revision of the court of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
The analyst of the Justice Department Paul Rowlett will testify during hours as a witness of the intelligence analysis.
The court will hear testimony about the use of the cell phone records to build the movements of the accused, 29-year-old Quinton Tellis, and the victim, 19-year-old Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett will say that he gave Chambers the phone numbers of different cell phones that were showing that Tellis was at Chambers' house the night he died, which contradicts earlier statements by Rowlett, according to The Clarion Ledger.
If the data shows that your mobile phone was in the vicinity at the time when you were with Michael Sanford, the police will talk to him.
Saturday, Sanford will deny that he was in the city on that day.
When the tax officials ask if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in the truck with Sanford that night, Sanford will say he lied, because his truck was in Nashville.
Another incoherence will be that Tellis will say that he knew two weeks before that Chambers was going to die.
The telephone registers show that the call was made only one week ago.
Rowlett will say that, after the death of Chambers, Tellis will suppress the messages of text, the tricks and the contact information of Chambers from his phone.
He will be taking away from his life.
The defense will start its final arguments on Monday.
The judge will say that he expected the trial to be finished by the end of the day.

Another black person?!
A woman from New York asked for a pair of shoes after receiving a racist message
A New York woman has filed a complaint against a man for a racist text message after she received a message from a man who was protesting because "there was another black person."
The couple denies that they are racist and compare the demand with an "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, will express her consternation at seeing that the new manager, Giselle Maurice, is black when she arrives to work on the first day of the new year.
“NOOOOOOOOOOO ANOTHER BLACK PERSON”, writes the lady Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
But, in the place of sending it to her husband, she sends it to the lady Maurice, twice.
After having been disappointed by the service, a "discomforting" Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman is going to accompany Mrs. Maurice to the meeting, saying that the woman who had accompanied her, who was African-American, had done a bad job and that she had expected a Filipino woman, in agreement with the New York Post.
The lady Maurice will pay the amount corresponding to her day of birth and, after that, she will send it home with an Uber.
Maurice demands compensation for the inconvenience and asks for a compensation of, approximately, 350 USD per day for the work he has done for the last four months, which he has not signed a contract for.
“I will show them that they can’t do things like that,” he said on Friday, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The girl has responded to the declarations that they are racist, saying that the agreement of Maurice was the most reasonable, since they do not trust her after having offered her a job.
My wife is going to send me something that she didn't want to say.
It's not racist.
No I am not a racist", said the man, Joel Plasco, to the Post.
But, leaving your children in the hands of someone who has been drinking, even if it was by mistake?
A baby?
Vinga.
Plasco, who has compared the demand with an "extortion", will say that the woman has two months to have a baby and that she was in a "very difficult situation."
“I’m going to pursue this thing?”
It is not a very nice attitude," said the investor.
The legal case is not yet resolved and the public opinion has already condemned the decision of the social xarxes and condemned the logic of the decision.
The editors of Paddington Bear think that the readers should not identify with a bear that speaks, in agreement with a new letter
The daughter of Bond, Karen Jankel, who is going to be published soon, will say in the interview: "It is difficult to put yourself in the place of someone who is going to publish for the first time."
It's very good, we know that those who know about the great escape of Paddington know it.
You will explain that your father, who had worked with the BBC camera before writing the children's book about a little mouse, was optimistic about the future of the book. You will also say that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books will be "sweet", after your father's death last year.
Paddington is a very important member of the family and it seems that his father was very proud of him, which is why he finally decided to leave.
He was a quiet man; he was not a presumptuous one.
But, how was Paddington so real for her, it's almost like when your child asks you for something: you're proud, even if it's not something you want.
He thought that was the way out of Paddington.
Paddington was the creation of the author and his imagination, and he always recognized the merit of his own work.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her over the phone
When they landed, they took her to the Louis Pasteur Hospital in Nice, where the doctors worked to save her life.
“I often told them it was very difficult and that I didn’t expect to succeed” said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
I was in a terrible accident and I was told I would die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to Nad.
I have done it.
I went to see Tashi, I love you so much.
I will fly with you.
I'm not going to eat you.
The medicines that they have given you because they have been consumed and have been excreted from your system.
He had died before the one who was supposed to be there and so he died.
Only I had to wait and I knew who was passing.
I couldn't cry or scream because I was surrounded by family and friends.
I've got to keep in good shape.
Finally, the lady Ednan-Laperouse, who has just lost her daughter, is going to board the plane with the rest of the passengers, distressed by the experience she has just been through.
No one knew, he said.
He had the cap and the tail, but he did not have the courage.
It's difficult to explain, but during the flight I felt a sense of sympathy for Nad the air hostess.
The sensation that I needed from my love and my understanding.
I know that I want a lot.
Women of the world are targets to prevent suicides
The people who have lost loved ones are working to prevent others from doing the same.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been targeted by a bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers to call if you need help.
The son of the lady Davis, Tyler, had 13 years when he started to suffer from depression and, at the age of 18, he committed suicide.
I will not feel what I have to feel nor what I have to feel each day.
The lady Davis, 45 years old, with residence in Lydney, will say that her son was a promising young man with a contagious smile.
“We know the truth about you.”
The light of his smile could illuminate any room.
The Catalan language is in danger of dying out before I die because it is so dark.
The year 2014, the German of Tyler, who had 11 years at that moment, he will find out that he had his own life.
The lady Davis will say: "I am always concerned about the collateral effect."
The lady Davis is going to create the targets "because the people should know that there are people to whom they can go, that they can listen to, and if it is about a friend.
No, you have to speak.
The lady Humphreys, who has been friends with the lady Davies for years, is going to lose Mark, her company, soon after the death of her husband.
He said that he was not depressed and that he was not feeling down.
“A few days before Christmas, I will be observing a change in attitude.”
I will play the flute on Christmas Day, when the children open their presents and they will not look at the others or the gifts.
You can imagine how much trauma it must have been for them, but they have to work: "Open a wound in the family.
He is going to destroy.
But we must continue and play the guitar.

The future of Brett Kavanaugh hangs by a thread as the FBI begins an investigation
I thought that if we could get something like what he was asking for (an investigation with a limited scope and time), we could achieve some unity.
Why did the Lord not want Kavanaugh and his Republican party to have an FBI investigation?
His reticence must have been at the moment.
Only five days remain for the elections of the 6th of November. If, as expected, the Republicans do not obtain good results, they will be weakened at the time of trying to get that the one that wants to be elected arrives at the principal tribunal of the country.
George W. Bush has been calling the phone to trick the senators and pressure them to vote for Kavanaugh, who worked for the White House under Bush. He also knows Ashley, Bush's wife, through his secretary.
What will happen after the FBI releases its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, on, now, there are 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not clear if the senator Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the Vice President, to break the tie and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
The name of desertors from North Korea "cau" with Kim
The name of desertors from North Korea to South Korea will be over when Kim Jong-un takes power in South Korea, according to a South Korean lawmaker.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Ministry of Unification, said that 1,127 deserters were reported last year, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
The Lord Park will say that the strict controls on the border between North Korea and China and the increase in the cost of traffickers of people have been the main factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comment.
Normally, the majority of desertors from the North offer the nationality of South Korea.
The fonts of Seul affirm that more than 30.000 north-Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
The majority escape through Xina, which has a longer border with North Korea and is easier to create than the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
Xina considers the deserters migrants illegal, in place of refugees and sometimes they are forced to return.
The relations between the North and the South, which technically are still at war, have improved considerably in the last few months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries will meet in Pyongyang to discuss the negotiations on denuclearization.
This will happen after the historic meeting between the US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they will agree in general terms to work to achieve a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea, Ri Yong-ho, will blame the sanctions of the United States for the lack of progress in the denuclearization process.
“I have confidence in the United States, but not in our national security and, in these circumstances, we will not disarm ourselves first, unilateralmente,” said the senator Ri in a speech to the General Assembly of the United Nations in New York.
Nancy Pelosi said that Brett Kavanaugh is a "historical" and that he is not fit for the Supreme Court
The leader of the minority of the Cambra Nancy Pelosi will say that the candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh is a "historical" and that his temperament makes him unfit to work at the Supreme Court.
Pelosi will make these comments in an interview with the Texas Tribune Festival on Saturday in Austin, Texas.
“I think it’s important to remember that if a woman had done this, she would have been called a “historical”, said Pelosi in relation to the testimony of Kavanaugh’s before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.”
Kavanaugh, emotional, will deny the accusations of having sexually abused the doctor Christine Blasey Ford when they were adolescents.
During his initial declaration, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes crying and not speaking for a while while talking about his family and his years at the institute.
We will also condemn explicitly the Democrats of the committee and we will say that the accusations against them are grotesque and coordinated by a person who is not a Democrat, but a liberal who is angry because Hillary Clinton will lose the presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi will say that the testimony of Kavanaugh showed that he could not work at the Supreme Court, since it showed his prejudices against Democrats.
I think that the Clinton campaign has been very unfair to him and the way they have attacked him,
Pelosi will show reticence when asked if she would try to block the confirmation of Kavanaugh, if he is confirmed, and if the Democrats advise the House to vote for the majority in the Senate.
This is what I can say: if he did not tell the truth to the Congress or the FBI, he is not capable of being at the Superior Court, but he is not capable of being at the Supreme Court either.
At the moment, Kavanaugh is a judge at the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Pelosi will add that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about the decisions that Kavanaugh could take against the Affordable Care Act and Roe v. Wade, since he is considered a conservative judge.
The Catalan government will not answer questions about whether it will appeal certain decisions of the Constitutional Court.
“It is not the moment for a person with a history of prejudice and bias to enter the Supreme Court and expect us to marvel at her,” Pelosi said.
Women have the right to exercise their power.
It is a justified diatribe: months and years of abundant fury and no one can cry without weeping.
“I weep because I have no shoes,” said the lady to the gentleman 45 years ago.
“I don’t think it will continue like this. And you?”
I'll continue... "I'll help you a lot, because I was a manager in a company where I was crying when I was angry, but I developed a tactic that consisted of, when I was angry and started to cry, to tell the person I was talking to: "Maybe you think I'm sad because I'm crying."
I'm angry.
After that, I continued.
It seems to be brilliant.
The llàgrimes are permitted as a sortida for the rage in part because, basically, they are misinterpreted.
One of the clearest records I have of one of my first fine pieces in an office with a majority of men, once I finished it I was so angry I was going to cry, it was the director of the company, who always scared me, who was going to grab me and throw me down the stairs.
“I don’t want to see you crying”, he said.
They don't know you're furious.
Think that you are sad and they will be happy, because they have you.
Patricia Schroeder, who was a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart as a presidential candidate.
In 1987, when the Lord Hart is discovered in an extramarital affair on a boat named Monkey Business and is forced to retire from the race, the Lady Schroeder, very frustrated, will think that there was no reason to not explore the idea of presenting herself as a candidate for the presidency.
It will not be a well-considered decision,
There were other candidates for the job and the last thing we needed was another one.
Someone will say "Blancaneu and the little ones"
As the campaign is going to be late, she will be very angry and will promise that she will not run for the presidency if she does not recapture 2 million dollars.
It was a lost battle.
You will discover that some of your party members, who have only 1,000 USD, are only willing to donate 250 to her.
“Do you think I have a discount?”
She will pronounce her speech and announce that she will not initiate a formal campaign, she is so overwhelmed by the emotions (gratitude for the people who have helped, frustration with the system for the difficulty of recovering diners and to orient themselves among the voters, in place of doing it among the delegates, and the rage, and the sexism) that she will remain without words.
“I could have had a nervous breakdown” Schroeder recalled about the reaction of the press.
I could have thought that my corporate sponsor was Kleenex.
I remember thinking: What will they put on my tombstone?
“Will you cry?”
The trade war between the US and China can benefit Beijing
The initial salvoes of the trade war between the US and China will be deafening and, until now, it does not seem that the war will end soon, a distance between the countries can be beneficial to Beijing in the long term, according to experts.
Donald Trump, the President of the United States, will issue his first warning to the beginning of this year, when he will impose tariffs on the main exports of China, such as solar panels, aluminum and aluminum.
The most significant climb this week will be the one we will make this week, with products worth 200 million dollars. These products will be subject to an import tax of 25% on all goods that arrive from China.
Beijing has responded to the same way every time and recently has put the brakes on the 60.000 million USD of American aid.
Xina has promised to replicate the US and it is not likely that the second largest economy in the world will be able to do so in the near future.
Washington has to take into account the new requests, but to publicly support them would be a very dangerous move for Xi Jinping, the President of China.
If China plays its cards well, the war could benefit China in the long term by reducing its dependence on the US.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that would start a cascade in any of these countries is much more dangerous than the testimony we have heard so far,” says Abigail Grace, an associate fellow at the Center for a New American Security, a Washington-based think tank.
Syria is "ready" to receive the refugees, according to the Minister of External Affairs
Syria says it is ready to receive the return of refugees and asks for help to rebuild the country, devastated for more than five years.
Before the General Assembly of the United Nations, the Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem will say that the conditions in the country are improving.
The situation on the street is more stable and safer, thanks to the progress that has been made in the fight against terrorism.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas that the terrorists are destroying to restore normality.
It is very complicated to return all the conditions for the return of the refugees to the country that have had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their livelihoods and their ability to maintain themselves.
The EU estimates that more than 5.5 million people have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
There are also millions of people who come to the country and need humanitarian aid.
The Syrian regime will say that it needs any help to rebuild the country.
However, I would like to highlight that I would not accept conditional aid nor the aid of the countries that are financing the insurgency.
The European Ryder Cup team has advised the victory in Paris
The European Ryder Cup team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National, the Parisian course.
The US has lost two Ryder Cups in a row on European soil and will be looking to regain the trophy in 1999.
The European team will be crowned champions if Thomas Bjorn's team can get the 14.5 points necessary to win the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who will play the major part of the tournament, will hit the ball into the water on the 16th hole, which will give the victory to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Francesco Molinari will shine in all his series and he will convert into one of the four players who have achieved the 5-0-0 in the format that has started since the 1979 season.
The American Jordan Spieth will be apart from the European team with the lowest qualifying score, the Dane Thorbjorn Olesen.
The most qualified player in the world, Dustin Johnson, will lose 2 and 1 against Ian Poulter, from England, who could have played the last Ryder Cup.
The veteran with 8 Ryder Cups, the Spanish Sergio Garcia, is going to be the major winner that the tournament has had the most, with 25,5 points.
“I can’t help but cry, but I can’t avoid it.”
It has been a very hard year.
Thanks, Thomas, for trialing me and creating in me.
I'm so happy, I've recovered the cup.
The team is the most important... I am very happy to have been able to help.
Pass the ball to John Ram, who will beat the legend of the American golf Tiger Woods 2&1 on Sunday.
I am incredibly proud to have been able to help Tiger Woods, I grew up following him.
Woods will lose the four matches he had in France and he has a record of 13-3-3 in the Ryder Cup.
One of the most statistically significant players in the history of the game, with 14 major titles and only one behind Jack Nicklaus.
The North American team will play all week to try to win the Ryder Cup, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who will play in high-level golf during the tournament.
The American captain, Jim Furyk, will talk about the frustrating result of his team: "I am proud of these players, they fought hard."
This morning we have had a moment in which we have pressed the European selection.
We are all together.
Thomas has taken the barret.
It's a great capità.
The 12 players have played very well.
We will regroup, work together with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and progress.
I think that these 12 players and I are proud to have been the captain.
There is no more than three of us.
They have been defeated.
Reduction of red tide concentrations in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota counties
