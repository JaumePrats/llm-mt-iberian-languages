Members of the Assembly (AM, for its English name) in Wales are concerned about “appearing like muppets”
Some Members of the Assembly are confused by the suggestion that their title should be changed to Members of the Welsh Parliament (MWP, by its English name).
This confusion arises from the plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the Assembly of all political spectrums are concerned that this might be ridiculed.
A member of the Labour Party's Assembly declared that the phrase “rims with Twp and Pwp” (the acronym for “Twp and Pwp” in English) was “unacceptable”.
For readers outside Wales: Twp means stupid and pwp means shit.
A Member of the Welsh Assembly Party said that the whole group was “dissatisfied” and suggested alternative.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said that his party was open to change of name, but noted that the change of pronunciation from MWP to muppet was small.
In this context, the pronunciation of the letter w in Welsh is similar to that of the letter u in Yorkshire.
The Commission of the Assembly, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the change of name, declares: “By definition, the final decision on any descriptive element of the membership of the Assembly will be the responsibility of the members themselves.”
The 2017 Welsh Government Act gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation that revealed a broad support for calling the Assembly the Parliament.
On the title of the Assembly Members, the Commission preferred the title of Members of the Parliament of Wales (MPW), but the MWP option received the majority of the support in a public consultation.
It seems that the members of the Assembly are suggesting alternative options, but the fight for consensus could lead to a stalemate for the Speaker, Elin Jones, who should send the bill on changes in a few weeks.
The legislation on reforms will include other changes related to the functioning of the assembly, such as rules on inhabilitation of Assembly Members and the design of committees.
The Members of the Assembly will have the last word on the question of how to name the body when it deliberates on legislation.
The Macedonians vote on a referendum on changing the country's name.
The voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change the country's name to “Republic of North Macedonia”.
The popular vote was called in an attempt to resolve a decades-old conflict with Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has consistently insisted on the name of its northern neighbor's claim to its territory and has opposed its bid for membership in the European Union and the NATO.
The president of Macedonia, George Ivanov, who opposes the referendum on the name change, has said he will ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including the Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that the name change is merely a price to pay to join the EU and the NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's Church ring silently because of the difficulties of the churches of Harlem.
“Historically, people I have spoken to say there was a bar and a church in every corner.
Today, there is no longer either.
He said that the closing of bars was understandable.
Now people socialize in a different way.
The bars are no longer the hubs of the neighborhood social scene.
He is concerned about the churches, as he believes that the money raised from the sale of goods will not last as long as the leaders expect and that “they will eventually return to the point of departure”.
Churches, he said, could be replaced by apartment buildings filled with people who would not help the shrines that remain in the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white people, and, therefore, accelerating the closure of these churches, as it is unlikely that the majority of people who move into these apartments will end up being members of these churches.”
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Church in 1870 and St. Martin's in the early 20th century.
The white Methodist congregation left in the 1930s.
A black congregation acquired the building.
A black congregation took the helm of San Martín, under the direction of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of the 125th Street shopping district, a main shopping street in Harlem, which resisted hiring or promoting black people.
In 1939, a fire left the building severely damaged and while the congregation of Father Johnson were making plans for its reconstruction, they also ordered the carillon.
The Reverend David Johnson, son and successor of the Rev. Johnson in San Martín, called it the “poor’s campaigns”.
In July, the carillon player called it a cultural treasure and a historical relic.
In addition, Tiffany Ng, a professor of music at Michigan University, said that it was the first carillon played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who went to play the larger carillon at Riverside Church, in New York, for 18 years.
Mr. Merriweather said that San Martín did not replace him.
What has happened in San Martín in the last months has been a complex story of architects and contractors, some brought by the leaders of the church and others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The parish board, the parish governing body, wrote to the diocese in July, expressing concern that the diocese was trying to pass the costs on to the board, even though the board had not participated in the hiring of the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of lack of transparency from the diocese.
Shark attacks a 13-year-old boy diving for lobsters in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while diving for lobsters on Saturday while the langostí­ season opened up.
The attack took place at about 7 am on the morning of June 24, 1852, near Encinitas Beach.
Chad Hammel reported to KSWB-TV in San Diego that he and his friends were diving with a child when they heard the child begging for help, so they went over to help him.
Hammel said he thought he was just happy to have captured a langost, but then he realized he was screaming that he had been bitten.
He had a broken clavicle.
I shouted to all to get out of the water because there was a shark.
The child was flown by helicopter to Rady Children Hospital, where he is in critical condition.
The species responsible for the shark attack is unknown.
The lifeguard, Larry Giles, said in a news conference that a shark had been sighted in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it had not been considered dangerous.
Giles said the victim had traumatic injuries to the upper torso.
The authorities closed the access to the beach, from Ponto Beach, in Casablad, to Swami Beach, in Encinitas, for 48 hours to investigate and for safety reasons.
Giles said there were 135 species of sharks in the area, but that most of them were not considered dangerous.
The Sainsbury's Beauty Plans are pushing the UK beauty market.
Sainsbury's acquires Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, which have many specialist staff in their shopping aisles.
To boost the UK beauty market, which is valued at £2800 billion and is growing at a faster rate than the fashion and home furnishings markets, the largest beauty aisles will be tested in 11 stores across the country and if they pass, they will be expanded in the next year.
The beauty investment arrives at the same time as the supermarket chain is looking for ways to use the space in shelves that was formerly reserved for televisions, microwaves and kitchenware.
Sainsbury's announced that it would double its beauty offerings with up to 3000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Additionally, existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees stores will be expanded to include a wider range of similar stores, such as Boots.
The company also plans to launch a new line of beauty products with a greater emphasis on animal-friendly ingredients.
The fragrance shop also tested its concessions in two Sainsbury's stores, the first opened in Croydon last week, and the second in Selly Oak later this year.
The online shopping and the shift towards daily small amounts of food purchases in local stores forces retailers to make an effort to convince customers to visit.
Mike Coupe, the executive director of Sainsbury's, has said that the shops will look more like supermarkets as the chain tries to combat the discount chains Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and products than food.
Sainsbury's has integrated discount stores in hundreds of stores and has introduced several Habitats since its purchase of these chains two years ago. It is considered that these acquisitions have boosted the food and retail sales.
The previous attempt to revamp its beauty and pharmacy departments was a failure.
Sainsbury's tested a joint operation with Boots in the early 2000s, but the collaboration ended after a dispute over how to split the pharmaceutical sales income in their supermarkets.
The new strategy is based on the sale of the 281 Sainsbury's pharmacy stores to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, in 2003 for 125 million pounds.
It is reported that Lloyds will be participating in the plan, adding a wider range of luxury skin care brands, such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
As Sainsbury's commercial director, Paul Mills-Hicks said, “We have transformed the appearance and environment of our beauty departments to enhance the environment for our customers.”
We have also hired a specialized staff to provide advice.
Our brand portfolio is designed to fit all needs. In addition, our attractive surroundings and convenient location make us a desirable destination for beauty products.
Peter Jones is furious after Holly Willoughby breaks a $11 million agreement.
Peter Jones, the star of Dragon’s Den, was “furious” after Holly Willoughby broke a deal of 11 million pounds with his lifestyle business to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for fashion and accessories.
This business had compared with the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The presenter of This Morning, 37, announced that she was leaving the business on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has angered Peter Jones, the star of the BBC’s "Dragon’s Den", by leaving her lucrative lifestyle job to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources consulted, Jones was “furious” when the gold girl of television admitted that her new contracts, valued at up to £1.5 million, did not leave time for Truly, her fashion and accessories brand, to be run by her during a tensa meeting held at her Buckinghamshire headquarters on Tuesday.
The business was compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow and was viewed as a favourite to double the fortune of Willoughby, which was around 11 million pounds.
While Willoughby, 37, announced he was leaving the business on Instagram, Jones left Britain to go to his holiday home.
As far as I can tell, this was the main priority of Holly.
It was to be their future at a long-term, which would have kept it for the next two decades.
His decision to leave left all involved completely stunned.
Nobody could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of merchandise in the Marlow headquarters.
Experts believe that the departure of the breakfast show's most profitable star could cost millions to the company as a result of the significant investment in products such as coffee mugs and clothing, and possibly delaying its launch.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, are parents of three children and have been in a relationship with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby established Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as president in March.
The couples went on holiday together and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace McPartlin as the presenter of the ITV celebrity show I'm a Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said that last night “business was not discussed”.
A difficult conversation, and then we fell in love.
I was making fun of the criticism he received from the media for making a comment that some would consider “poco presidencial” and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump commented with his sarcastic voice of a news anchor.
“I have not given up anything.”
He said he was interested in meeting with him after Trump praised the first meeting in June in Singapore, which he said was a great step towards the nuclear weapons-freeing of North Korea.
However, the nuclear weapons talks have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho explained to the leaders of the world assembled in the United Nations General Assembly that his country was not getting an “adequate” response from the United States to the first steps toward North Korea’s disarmament.
Unlike the United States, which still applies sanctions to maintain pressure, the European Union is more willing to negotiate with the Cuban government.
Trump's perspective was much more optimistic in his speech.
We have a great relationship with North Korea.
We were going to enter into a war with North Korea.
There would have been millions of deaths.
Now we have a fantastic relationship.
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim had resulted in positive results: the end of the missile tests, help for the release of American hostages and the return of American soldiers' remains from the battlefield.
He also defended his unusual approach to relations with Kim.
It is very easy to be president, but that, in place of 10,000 people outside this stadium trying to get in, we would have 200 people here, instead.
A tsunami and a major earthquake in Indonesia devastate an island, leaving hundreds dead.
After the Lombok earthquake, NGOs were reported to be told that their assistance was not needed.
Although more than 10 % of the population of Lombok had to flee, it was not declared an emergency national crisis, a prerequisite for international assistance to be mobilized.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it clear that they do not request international assistance, which makes it a little bit more difficult to get things done.
Although Save the Children is preparing a team to send to Palu, they do not yet know if foreign staff can work on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, the national emergency communications officer, said that the situation in Palu was being evaluated to see if international aid organizations could be allowed to help.
Considering that the land moves constantly in Indonesia, the country is still extremely unprepared when the natural disaster strikes.
Although shelters for tsunamis have been built in Aceh, they are not as common elsewhere on the coast.
It is likely that the apparent lack of warning sirens for tsunami warnings in Palu, even though there was a warning earlier, contributed to the loss of lives.
In the best of the cases, traveling from one Indonesian island to another is a challenge.
Natural disasters complicate logistics even more.
A hospital ship docked in Lombok to treat the victims of the earthquake is heading to Palu, but will take at least three days to reach the new disaster.
The president Joko Widodo converted the improvement of worn-out infrastructure in Indonesia to the central aim of his election campaign, and has spent considerable money on roads and railways.
However, funding shortages have affected the administration of Mr. Joko, who is running for re-election in the year ahead.
Additionally, it must deal with the persistent tensions in Indonesia, where members of the majority Muslim faith have adopted a more conservative faith.
Over 1,000 people died and tens of thousands had to flee their homes while Christian and Muslim bands fought on the streets using machetes, bows and arrows, and other rudimentary weapons.
This is: Daniel Sturridge, of Liverpool, ties the score with Chelsea.
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat in the Premier League by Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri to just over 27 m of the Chelsea goal when the score was 1-0.
He placed the ball on his left foot with a touch before launching it into the second corner.
The action sent him over the area and sent him to the right corner of the net.
Finally, the ball passed over Kepa Arrizabalaga who tried to stop it with a leap and fell into the net.
I was trying to get in that position to make me with the ball and the players always play a lot forward, so I gave them all the time I could.
I saw Kante coming and I gave him a touch. I didn't think too much, just fired the shot.
Chelsea was leading 1-0 at half-time after Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The midfielder made a cross to Kovacic on that play, before turning and making a dribble near the halfway line and then entering the Liverpool camp.
Kovacic passed the ball quickly and ran into the middle of the field.
After that, he made a beautiful pass to the space that took Hazard to the area.
Hazard was placed in front of the defence and kicked the ball into the net from the right side of the goal with a right foot kick that Alisson Becker, of Liverpool, could not stop.
The Liverpool play the Napoli on Wednesday at 15:00, in the Champions League group stage match. The match will be held at the San Paolo Stadium, in Naples (Italy).
The Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
The number of deaths from the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832.
The number of deaths from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has increased to 832, as reported by the disaster relief agency of the country.
Many people were trapped between the rubble of buildings that collapsed during the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that struck on Friday and which produced waves of up to six metres, according to the agency's spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho during a news conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with the rubble of the collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a man of 32 years as a suspect in the murder of a woman who was stabbed to death.
A murder inquiry has been opened after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 am on Grayson Mews, in John Street, which led to the arrest of a 32-year-old man as a suspect in her murder.
Police have advised people in the area to contact the police.
The Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in its early stages, but I would encourage anyone who was near John Street, Birkenhead, and had seen or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I would also recommend anyone, especially taxi drivers, who has captured something on camera that contacts us, as they can have vital information for our investigation.
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman whose body was found is from Birkenhead and that she was found in the interior of a property.
This afternoon some people who believe to know the woman arrived at the scene of the crime to learn where she had been found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and the police have reported that they are in the process of informing the victim's family.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has tried to return to his flat, but the police say nobody can enter or leave the building.
He was perplexed to discover what had happened.
Now, residents are informed that they will be allowed to return in a few hours.
Somebody heard a man tell a man that the whole area was being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared at the scene in tears.
He does not stop saying “it is terrible”.
At 2 p.m., there were two police vans outside the cordon and a third outside.
Many agents remained on the block, guarding the block.
Anyone with information should contact the DM at MerPolCC, call the 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at the number 247 on 30 September.
The Cromwell statue in Parliament Square is the latest in a series of commemorative statues that have been rewriting history.
The banning of the sale of alcohol would be a poetic justice for the destruction of so many cultural and religious objects and buildings in England carried out by fanatical followers of the puritanical fanaticism.
However, the Cromwell Society described the suggestion of Mr. Crick as a “madness” and an “intention to rewrite history”.
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the current debate on the removal of statues, it was inevitable that removing the figure of Oliver Cromwell from Westminster would become an objective.
The iconoclastic wars of the English Civil Wars were not ordered or carried out by Cromwell.
It may be that the wrong Cromwell is sacrificed for the wrong action of his ancestor, Thomas, in the previous century.
The magnificent portrait of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft of Cromwell is a testimony to the opinion of the nineteenth century and part of the historiography of a figure that many consider deserving of celebration.
As the Lord Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: “Some consider Cromwell, perhaps more at the end of the nineteenth century than now, a defender of parliament against external pressure, in this case, the monarchy.
If it is a precise description, then the debate on the historical accuracy of the statement is still ongoing.
It is certainly true that the conflict of the mid-17th century has shaped the later development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable face of that division.
His achievements as Protector Lord are worthy to be celebrated and commemorated.
A killer pig attacks a Chinese farmer.
A pig attacked and killed a dairy farmer in a market in the southwest of China, according to local media.
The man, identified only by his surname “Yuan”, was found dead with a cut artery and covered in blood near a pigsty in the market of Liupanshui, in the province of Guizhou, as the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer is preparing to inject vaccines into pigs in a pig farm in Xining, in the province of Qinghai (China).
According to reports, he traveled with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his uncle found him dead and discovered that the door to a pigsty was open.
He said that in the pigsty there was a large pig with blood in its mouth.
The forensic examination confirmed that the hog had attacked the farmer until he died, according to the report.
“My cousin’s legs were bloody and broken,” said the cousin, whose name is Wu, to the Evening News.
The security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found approximately an hour after.
The animal that killed the man was not a Yuan nor was his cousin.
A market manager reported to The Evening News that pigs were kept in a pen to prevent them from attacking anyone else, while police collected evidence at the scene.
It seems that the family of Yuan and the market authorities are negotiating a compensation for his death.
Although rare, pigs have attacked people on occasion.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man seriously injured.
Ten years before, a hog weighed 295 lbs.
After a herd of pigs ate a farmer in Oregon in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba declared to CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but blood can act as a “trigger”.
They are just playing.
They are like children, very curious... their intention is not to do harm.
What needs to be done is to respect them appropriately.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will bring heavy rainfall to the southwestern United States.
As expected, the hurricane weakened as it moved over cooler waters of the north coast of Mexico.
However, the hurricane will drop torrential rainfall across much of Mexico and the southwestern United States in the next days.
The hurricane caused winds of 136 km/h, a Category 1 hurricane, from Sunday at 5:00 a.m. (Eastern time) and was located about 620 km (385 mi) southwest of Punta Eugenia (Mexico).
It is expected that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
While southeastward-moving low-pressure areas are forming in the Pacific Ocean, they are moving towards the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches Baja California on Monday, a tropical storm will start pushing the intense tropical rainfall in a northwestward direction, towards the southwestern United States.
Rain will be expected to fall in some areas of Mexico on Monday.
Finally, when the tropical rain meets the low pressure that is approaching, there will be heavy rainfall over the southwestern part of the country for the next few days.
Between 2 and 10 cm of rain will cause flash flooding, mudslides, landslides, and possible landslide deposits in the desert.
Tropical rainfall will cause up to 8 inch per hour of rainfall in specific areas, especially in the south of Nevada and Arizona.
We expect between 5 and 10 cm of rain in the southwest, especially in the major part of Arizona.
Because of the scattered nature of the tropical rains, flash flooding may occur quickly and unexpectedly.
For this threat of torrential tropical rainfall, it is absolutely advisable not to venture out into the desert on foot.
Wet weather could turn canyons into rivers and strong thunderstorms will cause winds and dust storms locally.
Low pressure systems that approach will bring heavy rainfall to parts of the southern California coast.
Monsoon rains can cause small mudslides and make roads slippery.
It would be the first heavy rainfall of the region during the wet season.
Some tropical showers may start to approach Arizona at the end of Sunday and the beginning of Monday, before rain is expected to spread to the end of Monday and the beginning of Tuesday.
The heavy rains will extend to the Four Corners on Tuesday and through Wednesday.
In October, there will be some sharp temperature changes in the United States as the Arctic cools and the tropics warm.
At times, this means abrupt temperature changes in short distances.
An example of these differences is what will happen in the middle of the United States on Sunday.
There will be a difference of nearly 7 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, and between St. Louis and Des Moines.
Over the next few days, the long summer heat will try to recover and return to its former scale.
In a large part of the central and eastern United States, a warm start is expected, with temperatures ranging from 26 °F to the South to parts of the Northeast.
Tuesday, in New York City temperatures could reach 26 degrees, 12 degrees above the average.
Our long-term forecast indicates high temperatures above-average for the eastern United States during the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched the appearance of Brett Kavanaugh.
More than 20 million people watched the shocking testimonies that Brett Kavanaugh, the candidate for the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of a sexual assault in the 1980s, gave on six television networks.
While the politics continued to stalemate and the media interrupted their regular programming to retransmit the latest Friday's news: a design by Arizona Senator Jeff Blake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation of the allegations.
Ford told the Judiciary Committee of the Senate that he is absolutely certain that Kavanaugh touched her in a drunken stupor and tried to strip her naked in a party at a high school.
During his passionate testimony, Kavanaugh said he was completely certain that it had not happened.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people watched the programme on Friday.
The media audience was counted for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not available immediately for other channels, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Additionally, Nielsen often has trouble estimating how many people see something in the office.
It is a similar audience to that of a football game in the playoffs or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose hosts have supported Kavanaugh's nomination, was the leading network, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during a day-long hearing that lasted all day, according to Nielsen.
ABC placed second, with 3.26 million viewers.
The CBS had 3,1 million, the NBC had 2,94 million, MSNBC had 2,89 million and CNN had 2,52 million, said Nielsen.
After the hearing, there was still a great deal of interest.
Flake was the central character in the Friday's drama.
After the moderate office's office issued a statement saying it would vote for Kavanaugh, the morning of Friday, CNN and CBS cameras captured how protesters shouted at him when he tried to climb into an elevator to attend a hearing before the Judiciary Committee.
While being subjected to these reproaches, they were broadcast live on CNN, and he was shown to be depressed.
“Lookin’ at me face to face”, said a woman.
Do you think he is telling the truth to the country?
And you have power when there are many women who don’t have it.
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and, before the doors of the elevator closed, he would be giving more details in his appearance before the Commission.
Cable and broadcast television networks and radio stations aired everything live hours later, when the Judiciary Committee had to vote to propose Kavanaugh's nomination to the Senate to be voted on.
However, Flake said he would only do so if the FBI investigated the allegations made against the candidate during the following week, which had been requested by some Democrats.
Flake was convinced, in part by conversations he had had with his friend, the Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several other senators later, Flake took his decision.
The decision by Flake was fundamental, as it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to pass Kavanaugh without that investigation.
The FBI is investigating the allegations against Kavanaugh.
The British Prime Minister accuses critics of “political” with Brexit
The first minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of “doing politics” with the future of Britain and undermining the national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
The first British PM, Theresa May, arrives at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In another interview published with his former Foreign Affairs minister, Boris Johnson, his former Foreign Affairs minister, Boris Johnson, insisted on his attack on the so-called Chequers plan for the brexit, saying that a proposal for the EU and Britain to charge tariffs on each other was “totally absurd”.
As the murder of Wayde Simpson: Police arrested Dyteon Simpson as a suspect in the murder of LSU player.
Police have arrested a suspect for the murder of Wayde Sims, a basketball player from LSU, during a shooting.
Dyteon Simpson, a 20-year-old, has been arrested and charged with second-degree murder, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities made a public video of the fight between Sims and Simpson, and the police said that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses at the crime scene and said they had DNA evidence on them, according to WAFB, a CBS affiliate.
After interrogating Simpson, the police said that he admitted shooting Wayde.
The bail was set at $350,000, according to the defense.
The Baton Rouge East District Court Judge published a preliminary report indicating that the cause of death had been a gunshot wound to the head that had reached the top of the skull.
The department recognizes the merits of the Fugitive Unit of the Louisiana State Police, the Criminalistics Laboratory of the Louisiana State Police, the Southern University Police Department and citizens for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, LSU's athletic director, thanked the police for their diligence and search for justice.
Simpson was 20 years old.
The player, who was over two meters tall, grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds in a last season's game.
Friday morning, LSU's basketball coach Will Wade said his team was “devastated” and “shocked” by Wayde's death.
These are the things that always trouble people.
A volcano is erupting ash in Mexico City.
Ash from the Popocatépetl volcano has reached the southern part of Mexico City.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexican tourists to stay away from the volcano after it showed activity and registered 183 emission of gas and ash in 24 hours.
The center of the earthquake zone was struck by several earthquakes and shaking.
In social media, images showed thin coats of ash covering the windshields of cars in Mexico City's Xochimilco neighborhood.
Geophysicists have observed a greater volcanic activity, located 72 km south of the capital, since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake hit the center of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, is active since 1994.
Police are confronted with separatists in Catalonia on the anniversary of the referendum on independence.
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after anti-independence protesters clashed with police as thousands of people took to the streets in opposition to the anniversary of the polarized referendum on secession.
A group of separatists in plain clothes who had been blocked by police were throwing eggs and powder at them, creating a cloud of dust in the streets, which normally are filled with tourists.
There were also riots afterwards and police used batons to control the fighting.
During several hours, separatist groups, with slogans like “neither forgiveness nor amnesty”, clashed with unionist protesters, chanting “Long live Spain”.
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests, according to local media.
The tensions remain high in this region one year after the October 1, illegal vote, but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
The voters chose independence by a landslide, although turnout was low, as those opposed to secession boycotted the referendum.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to prevent the voting in tables in the whole region, where violent clashes broke out.
The groups supporting independence camped on Friday night to prevent a rally in support of the National Police.
The demonstration continued ahead, but had to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who was at the separatist protest said he had no hope that Catalonia would ever be independent.
The year before we had our best year.
I saw my parents cry with joy to be able to vote, but now we are stuck.
Although the pro-independence parties achieved a narrow victory in the regional elections last December, they have struggled to maintain the momentum this year, as many of their most well-known leaders, either in exile or in custody, are awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, who recorded the protest in support of the police on his phone, said the conflict had been sparked by politicians on both sides.
The tension is rising.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, announced that he would be running for election to the European Parliament in 2019.
"Running for election to the European Parliament is the best way to denounce the regression in democratic values and repression that we have seen from the Spanish Government," said.

Three men, of 33, 34 and 39 years, have been arrested after repeatedly hitting a house with a car.
The incident occurred on Thursday evening in Ballynagard Crescent.
The inspector Bob Blemmings said that damage to access points and the building itself were caused.
It is possible that a bow and arrow has been fired at the car.
A Menga attack gives the Livingston a 1-0 victory over the Rangers
The first goal by Dolly Menga for Livingston secured the victory.
A promoted Livingston impressed Rangers fans by beating the club's record of 18 wins from Gerrard's first 18 games as manager.
The attack by Dolly Menga marked the difference. The Gary Holt boys rose to second place, with the Hibernian in second place.
This season, the Gerrards have yet to win any away games and the next Sunday they will play against Hearts, leaders of the table with eight points ahead.
Before the Rangers receive Rapid Wien on Thursday in the Europa League.
While the Livingston has continued its winning streak to six games. Holt, the interim head coach, has yet to taste defeat since he took over from Kenny Miler in late October.
Livingston leaves opportunities to a visitor who is unbeatable.
The Holt team had to have gone ahead a lot earlier than they did, causing a lot of problems for the Rangers by their direct play.
Scott Robinson overcame the defence, but his shot went wide of the post after he had taken a corner. Alan Lithgow then missed the cross after Craig Halkett headed in a corner.
The hosts' team was content to let the Rangers play ahead of them, knowing that they could cause problems for visitors with free kicks.
So it was as he scored the winning goal.
The Rangers gave them a free kick and Livingston looked for a way to break through, with a Declan Gallagher and Robinson combination for Menga, who scored from the centre of the area.
In that moment, the Rangers held the ball, but could not break the defence of the host, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was quite calm.
The game continued until the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced a stoppage for Kelly.
Allan McGregor, Rangers goalkeeper rejected a shot by Scott Pittman and Lithgow was far away from another shot by Livingston.
In the Livingston area, long passes were constantly coming in, but they were always cleared. Two penalty appeals were denied, one after a hand-ball by Halkett on the substitute Glenn Middleton and the other after a hand-ball by the substitute John McDonald.
“Fantastic” from Livingston (analysis)
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Stadium
A great performance and a fantastic result for Livingston.
The unanimous opinion is that they did a superb job, and they kept rising in the rankings.
His style of play and his squad hasn't changed much since their promotion, but this is largely due to Holt's recruitment of players from the team since his arrival.
It had many heroes.
Halkett, the captain of the team, was enormously large and led a magnificently organized defense, while Joe Worrall and Connor Goldson kept the two Connors alert at all times.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although they had some good moments with Gerrard, they were not quite good enough.
They lacked the scoring ability, as they only managed to get into the opponent's half once, which is a warning to the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan has received a mixed reception in Colonia.
On Saturday, 29 September, there were smiles and a blue sky during the breakfast of German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
It is the last day of the controversial visit of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to Germany, with the aim of restoring the alliance ties between NATO allies.
They have discussed issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the European Union.
After Erdogan visited Colonia to open a new mosque.
The city hosts the largest population of Turks outside Turkey.
The police said security reasons were given for preventing 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many sympathisers gathered in the vicinity to see their president.
The protesters also echoed the Kurdish opposition to Erdogan's policies, as well as the decision of Germany to receive him in the country.
These demonstrations reflect the divisive nature of this visitor, received as a hero by some German Turks and considered an autocrat by others.
A traffic accident in Deptford: a cyclist dies after being struck by a car.
A cyclist has died in a car accident in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwookd Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, south of the city, at 10:15.
The driver of the car stopped and the cyclist was attended by paramedics, but died on the spot.
The accident occurred after another cyclist died after being hit by a vehicle that fled the scene at Childers Street, about two kilometres from the site of the accident on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said that they were working to identify the man and inform his family.
Roads have been cut and buses diverted, and warnings were issued to drivers to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: six policemen injured after riots
Six prison officials were injured in a prison riot in a high-security prison for men, according to the prison authority.
The riots began in the Long Lartin Prison, Worcestershire, at 9:30 on Sunday and still continue.
A specialist team of a top-level team (called “Tornado”) is handling the riots, in which eight inmates are involved and which affects a wing.
The agents received assistance for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A prison spokesman said: “A specialized prison guard force has been deployed to deal with the ongoing incident at Long Lartin Prison.
Six members of the medical staff have received medical assistance for injuries.
In our prisons violence is not tolerated and we make it clear that those responsible will be brought to justice and could be put in jail for a longer period of time.
Long Lartin Prison holds more than 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, a prison director was treated for injuries after a prisoner attacked him.
In October last year, agents of the riot police were called to the prison to deal with a serious incident in which a prisoner was attacked with billiard balls.
The hurricane threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with flash flooding (arid areas could benefit)
It is unusual for a tropical depression to reach Arizona, but that is exactly what could happen in the coming days as the remnants of Hurricane Rosa cross the Southwest desert, with the potential for flash flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings for flash flooding on Monday and Tuesday in the west of Arizona, the south and east of Nevada, and the southeast of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
The hurricane is expected to make landfall in the Gulf of California on Tuesday, with the remnants moving into the Southwestern United States on Wednesday.
The Phoenix Weather Service said in a tweet that only ten hurricanes had maintained their tropical storm status or depression within a 321 km (200 mi) radius of Phoenix since 1950.
In 1967, Hurricane Katrina was only 65 km from the border of Arizona.
The last models of the National Hurricane Center forecast from 5 to 10 inch of torrential rainfall, which can reach 15 inches in isolated areas of the Mogollon Rim.
It is likely that between 2 and 5 cm of rain will fall, with the possibility of reaching 10 cm in isolated areas of the southwestern desert, including the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin.
In places where there is no risk of flash flooding, the rains are a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Although a flood is a very serious matter, it is likely that some of these torrential rains will be beneficial because of the current drought conditions in the southwest.
According to the United States Drought Monitor, more than 40% of Arizona is suffering from at least extreme drought, the second highest category, as reported on weather.com.
First, the hurricane will strike Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, which on Sunday morning will still have a powerful hurricane with maximum winds of 136 km/h, is 619 km south of Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and is moving north at 19 km/h.
The storm is encountering colder waters in the Pacific, so it is losing strength.
The storm is expected to make landfall in Mexico with the intensity of a tropical storm on Monday.
Moderate to severe rainfall could fall in some areas of Mexico, which would be a significant risk of flooding.
“Forecast of torrential rainfall of between 7 and 15 cm from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with a possibility of reaching 25 cm, as reported by weather.com.”
After that, Rosa will head north to Mexico as a tropical storm, before reaching the border of Arizona in the early morning hours of Tuesday. Later, she will move south into Utah, where she will be heading for the last time at the end of the night of Tuesday.
The main threat to Rosa or her remains is the heavy rainfall in Baja California, the northwestern part of Sonora and the southwestern part of the United States’s deserts.
It is expected that these heavy rains will cause flash flooding and mudslides in the deserts, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
At the Midsomer Norton raid: four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old have been arrested as suspects in an attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with a knife wound.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, at 4:00 on Saturday.
He was transferred to a hospital, where he is now “stable”.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and one 20-year-old were arrested that same night in the Radstock area, according to the Avon Police.
The agents have made a call for anyone who may have recorded the incident with a mobile phone.
Trump says Kavanaugh “sufrió la mezquindad y la ira” of the Democratic Party.
“Voting for the judge Kavanaugh is voting to reject the tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said in a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has “suffered the venom and anger of the Democratic Party throughout the entire process of nomination.”
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, denying the allegation of Christine Blasey Ford that she had been sexually assaulted by him when she was a teenager.
He also testified on this charge.
On Saturday, the president said that, that day, Americans saw the cunning, quality, and courage of Kavanaugh.
“Voting to confirm Kavanaugh is voting to confirm one of the most accomplished legalists of our time, a jurist with a record of admirable public service.”
The president made indirect references to Kavanaugh's nomination by referring to the importance of Republican participation in mid-term elections.
There are five weeks left for one of the most important elections in our lives.
I don't present myself, but I am a runner.
So I go from place to place fighting for great candidates.
Trump claimed that Democrats are on a mission of “resistance and obstruction”.
The first key vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's confirmation is expected to be held no later than Friday, said a high-level Republican Party official to CNN.
Hundreds of deaths from a earthquake and a tsunami in Indonesia are rising.
At least 384 people have died and many have been washed away by the enormous waves that were generated by a powerful earthquake and a massive tsunami in the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, as reported by local authorities.
Centenars of people had gathered to celebrate a festival on the beach of the city of Palu when waves of up to six metres high came ashore at dusk, wrecking everything in their path and killing many.
The earthquake occurred after a 7.5 earthquake.
“When a tsunami warning was issued, people were still on the beach and so were not immediately evacuated, so they were victims,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB, por sus siglas en indonesio) of Indonesia, said in a news conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami did not come alone, it carried cars, logs, houses, everything that was on land,” said Nugroho. The tsunami had moved through the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
He also said that some people had climbed to the trees to escape the tsunami and had survived.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 shelters in Palu.
Photographs of the air photos showed the destruction of many buildings and shops, bridges broken and collapsed, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The earthquakes continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes affected a population of 2.4 million people.
The BPPT reported that the energy released by the great earthquake of Friday was 200 times greater than the energy released by the atomic bomb that fell on Hiroshima in World War II.
He added that the geography of the city, which sits at the end of a long and narrow bay, may have amplified the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as “significant” and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, commercial buildings and hotels had been destroyed.
According to him, bodies of some of the victims trapped under the rubble of the destroyed buildings were found. 540 people had been injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the number of casualties and damage could be higher along the 300 km coastline to the north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications were completely shut down and there was no information about Donggala.
There are 300,000 people living in the area.
This is already a tragedy in itself, but it could be much worse.
On Saturday, the agency received many criticisms for not reporting that a tsunami had hit Palu, even though the waves had already reached the coast when the warning was issued.
In a video captured by an amateur and shared on social media, a man on the last floor of a building is heard warning people on the street that a tsunami is approaching.
In a matter of minutes, a wall of water hits the coast, tearing down buildings and cars.
Reuters could not verify the material immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that cut off communications in the area around Palu, making coordination of rescue efforts difficult.
The army started sending cargo planes with humanitarian aid from Jakarta and other cities, but the people evacuated still need food and other essentials.
The airport in the city has reopened only for relief and emergency services and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the shelters on Sunday.
The number of deaths from the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami is over 800.
It is very bad.
Although the World Vision staff in Donggala have arrived unharmed to Palu, where they are sheltered under a tent set up in the garden of their offices, they have seen a devastating panorama on their way, reported Mr. Doseba.
They said they had seen many houses destroyed.
It is very bad.
Even as the disaster relief teams were putting together the machinery of assistance, some people were lamenting that there was no way to get to Palu for those with extensive experience.
According to Indonesian law, only foreign funding, supplies and personnel can be used if the affected area is declared a national disaster zone.
That has not yet happened.
“It is still a disaster at a provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Red Cross in Indonesia.
When the Government declares it is a national disaster, we can start to send international aid, but that has not yet happened.
As the second night fell in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami of Friday, friends and family of those still missing were still hoping that their loved ones would be the miracles that would bring some light to the devastating stories that they wrote about natural disasters.
On Saturday, a baby was pulled out of a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days with her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, the national paragliding team's instructor, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended in Indonesia a few days before that same month.
Other people who were trapped in the hotel Roa Roa, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
I have a lot of experience in the field of paragliding, and I carry my own emotional load.
Mr. Gendon recalled how, following the news that the Roa Roa hotel had collapsed, he had sent desperate messages to the competitors in the paragliding festival that was being held on the beach.
However, their messages only showed a check mark in grey, not two marks.
I think that that meant the messages were not delivered.
Robbers stole $26,750 from a bank ATM in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, a robbery took place at a Brink ATM in Newport on the Levee, with 26,750 USD stolen, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car had emptied an ATM located in the entertainment centre and was preparing to recharge it with more money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in the note.
While he was busy, another man ran behind the employee and stole a bag of money intended for the reloading of the money.
According to the report, there were several witnesses who saw the suspects leaving the scene, but the police did not specify the number of suspects involved.
Anyone with information about their identities should contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: the rapper changed his name to Ye.
Kanye West will be known as Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday: “The person previously known as Kanye West”.
He has been called Ye for a long time now, and he used it as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change arrives before its appearance on Saturday Night Live, where it is expected to present its new album, Yandhi.
The singer Ariana Grande, who had to cancel her performance for “emotional reasons”, as the show's creator put it.
He also said that the word had a religious significance for him.
“I think it’s the most used word in the Bible, where it means ‘you’”, commented West to a radio host in early this year while talking about the title of his album with Big Boy.
We are you, we are us.
It was Kanye, which means ‘the only’, to become Ye, a reflection of our good, bad and confused things, all.
The album is more a reflection of who we are.
It is one of the many famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs has been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
A former collaborator of West, Jay-Z, has used his name in all caps or in all caps without a space.
The Mexican president-elect Andrés Manuel López Obrador promises not to use the army against the civilian population.
Andrés Manuel López Obrador, the elected president of Mexico, has pledged never to use the army against the civilian population, now that the 50th anniversary of a bloodshed against students in Mexico is approaching.
On Saturday, López Obrador pledged in Tlatelolco square that he would never use the army to repress the people of Mexico.
On 2 October 1968, troops fired on a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing 300 people.
President López Obrador has pledged to support Mexican youth by providing monthly grants to students and opening more public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities led to young people joining criminal gangs.
The United States should double its funding for I. A.
Now that China is more active in artificial intelligence research, the U.S. should double its investment in this field, Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and professional of I. A. who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments arise after the announcements made by the U.S. Government regarding the I. A. of several parts of its Government, even when, in general, the United States lacks an official I. A. policy.
Meanwhile, China's plan was presented in the past year: its goal is to be the number 1 in innovation by 2030.
“Doubling the budget for I. A. research would be a good start, given that most other countries are far behind the United States in the field of I. A.”, says Lee.
Double funding means double the chances of the next major achievement in I. A. being reached in the U.S., as Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the executive director of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most important I. A. in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University, where he developed a computer chess system that beat the best American chess player.
He gave recognition to the previous US Government robotics competitions, such as the DARPA Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next generation of visionaries would be.
In the United States, researchers often have to work hard to get government grants, as they do in Chile.
“China is not the one that is taking the academic leaders; it is the corporations.”
In the last few years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired university-trained people to work in I. A.
He said that changes in immigration policy could help the United States intensify its efforts in I. A.
I think that doctors in I. A. should be given permanent residency cards automatically.
The State Council of China presented its AI Development Plan in July 2017.
The National Natural Science Foundation of China funds people from academic institutions as the National Science Foundation and other government agencies fund researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work in China is lower than that in the United States.
In the first half of this year, the Department of Defense established a Joint Intelligence Center, whose purpose is to attract partners from the industrial and academic sectors.
In addition, this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in a project called AI Next.
The National Science Foundation invests more than $100 million a year in scientific research.
While the American legislation that created a National Commission on Artificial Intelligence Security has not taken any action in months.
The Macedonians voted in a referendum on whether to change their country's name.
The Macedonians voted in a referendum on Sunday to change their country's name to “Republic of North Macedonia”, a gesture that would resolve decades of conflict with Greece, which had blocked its EU and NATO membership.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its neighboring country's name is a claim on its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, both governments reached an agreement on a new name, but the opposition nationalists claim that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic population in Macedonia.
The president Ivanov has said he would not vote in the referendum and a campaign of boycott has put doubt on whether the minimum turnout required for the referendum to be valid would be reached.
The referendum question asked the following question: “Do you support the accession to the NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?”
Opponents of the name change, including the first Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say it is a price worth paying to make Macedonia one of the countries that emerge from the breakup of Yugoslavia, so that Macedonia can access the EU and the NATO.
“Today I have come to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live with freedom under the European Union, which means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, a number of members of Parliament have said they would respect the result of the vote to ensure a clear majority.
The name change requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The Electoral Commission declared that, at noon on the day of the election, no irregularities had been reported.
However, participation was only 16%, compared with 34 % in the last elections to the Parliament, when 66 % of registered voters cast their ballots.
“I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in Skopje.
Zoran Zaev, the first Macedonian prime minister, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko deposed their ballot in the referendum on a name change for Macedonia that would open the way for membership in NATO and the European Union in Strumica (Macedonia) on 30 September 2018.
Before Parliament, in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small stage and removed chairs from the tents set up by those who were going to boycott the referendum.
We are in favour of joining NATO and the EU, but we want to do it with our heads up, not behind our backs.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If we don't want to be in Macedonia, we can establish relations with other countries, such as China and Russia, and join the European Union and the Euro-Asian Union.
Prime Minister Zaev says that Macedonia's membership in NATO would bring investment that the country needs, which is 20% unemployment.
I believe that the majority will be in favour, as more than 80% of the citizens support the EU and NATO.
He said that a positive result would be a confirmation of our future.
In a poll published on Monday last week, the Institute for Policy Research said that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, which means a lower turnout than the required.
Another poll by Macedonian TV revealed that 57 % of those polled planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote for him.
A referendum is considered successful if the turnout is at least 50 percent plus one vote.
If the plan fails, it would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government that took power in May of this year.
This: Sergio Agüero, from Manchester City, evades the whole Brighton defence to score a goal.
Sergio Agüero and Raheem Sterling broke the Brighton defence in the 2-0 victory Manchester City achieved at the City of Manchester Stadium on Saturday.
It was ridiculously easy to score a goal in the 65th minute.
The midfielder received a pass in the middle of the field.
The three-ditch system was run between three defences of Brighton before entering open ground.
Once there, he was surrounded by four green shirts.
He evaded a defender before dribbling past several more players on the edge of the Brighton penalty area.
He made a left turn, where he was joined by Sterling.
The English striker used his first touch in the area to return the ball to Agüero, who then hit the ball with his right foot to deny the goalkeeper with a right-footed shot that reached the right side of the net.
"Agüero has a few problems with his foot", said Pep Guardiola, City manager, to the press.
We would expect him to play between 55 and 60 minutes.
That happened.
We were lucky to have scored a goal in that moment.
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the early lead in the Premier League.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
In that play, Agüero received the ball just inside Brighton's territory.
He made a beautiful pass to the left flank for Leroy Sane.
Sane gave some touches before Sterling was directed to the second spar.
The striker from the Sky blues scored just before the ball went out of bounds.
The City will face Hoffenheim in a Champions League group game on Tuesday at 12:55 at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim (Germany).
Scherzer wants to ruin the party for the Rockies.
With the National eliminated from the playoffs, there was no reason to force a second opening.
Still, Scherzer is determined to pitch on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Dodgers, who have won the West Division of the National League, have a chance in the playoffs.
The Rockies secured at least a wild card spot with a 5-2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but still chase their first division title.
Although we don't play for anything, at least we can step on the rubber with the certainty that the Denver audience will be cheering and that the other team will probably play at a higher level than I have played this year.
Why not?
The Nationals have yet to announce a starter for Sunday, but it appears that they are inclined to leave Scherzer in that situation.
Scherzer, who has made his 34th start, will have a practice session on Thursday and will return to his normal rest on Sunday.
The Washington toreter's record is 18 wins and 7 losses, with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts with 2/3 in 220 entries.
Trump holds a rally in West Virginia.
The president made indirect references to the Kavanaugh case, his selection for the Supreme Court, by mentioning the importance of Republican participation in mid-term elections.
In November, it is at stake everything we have done.
There are five weeks left for one of the most important elections in our lives.
It is one of the most important. I don't present myself, so I don't have to be there, so I'm going from place to place fighting for great candidates.
We have this terrible radical democratic group, which is now happening right now.
They are determined to regain power by all means necessary, and they see malice, evilness.
They don't care who they hurt or who they have to crush to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control. And we won't give it to them.
Democrats, he said, are engaged in a mission of “resistance and obstruction”.
We have seen it over the last four days, saying that Democrats were “very angry, bad, and false”.
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee by naming Dianne Feinstein, who received the boos of the audience.
“Do you remember his reply?”
Do you filter the document?
Mmm, Mmm, what?
No, no, I don't think so. I think it was a terrible body language.
The Labour Party is now a broad spectrum party.
It is intolerant of people who say what they think.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censure me, I wasn't surprised.
After all, I am the last of a long line of Labour MPs who are told that they are not welcome, and only because they say what they think.
My colleague in the Parliament, Joan Ryan, was clearly against anti-Semitism.
My motion of censure was criticised for not being in agreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
He disagreed with the importance of a responsible economic policy, in national security matters, on Europe. It is ironic that he disagreed with leaders before him.
As such, we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.
During the eight years I have been a member of the local Labour Party Parliamentary Party Committee, that is exactly what the Friday night meetings of the General Committee have been.
Unfortunately, this is not the current tone of many meetings and the promise of a more gentle and kindly policy is now forgotten, if it ever was.
The views that differ from the party line are clearly being suppressed in the Labour Party and judged on whether the leaders of the party consider them acceptable or not.
This began after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues with whom he shared a similar political vision started to expect him to change his mind and adopt radically different views, which he had never held before, on security or on the single market of the European Union.
Always that I speak in public, regardless of what I say, there is a diatribe of insults on the internet, demanding my removal, accusing the centre of policies that I should not be in, and saying I should not be in the Labour Party.
I've been through it myself.
I am fortunate to be more fortunate than my colleagues, as political comments tend to be made on me.
I'm amazed by the professionalism and determination of colleagues who are continually subjected to sexist and racist abuse, but never flee.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the normalization of insult.
The week before, Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that now we have a narrower range of opinions and with each motion “of censure” or each change in the selection rules, the party becomes narrower.
In the last two years, I have received many counsels that recommended I keep my head down and not make myself too noticeable.
But I don't get involved in politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party in 1974, I was motivated by the neglect of the Thatcher government that left my school in a shattered state, and I have tried to improve the public services for those who need them most, whether as a councillor or as a minister.
I have never concealed my political views, either.
It is impossible that anyone in Nottingham East would have been unaware of my political views and areas in which I did not agree with the current leaders.
I would say to those who promoted the motion that I don't understand these efforts to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Leader of the Labour Party when the country is heading for a Brexit that will affect homes, businesses and public services.
The real message is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for the electorate, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve them and I promise that no threat of withdrawal or any opportunism will prevent me from acting according to what I believe is best for all of you.
Chris Leslie is a Member of Parliament for Nottingham East.
Ayr 38 - Melrose 17: Ayr is undefeated.
Two late goals in the last game of the match may have decided the final result, but, without doubt, Ayr deserved the win in this entertaining Premiership game.
Now they are the top team in the table and are the only team to remain undefeated.
The end result was the superiority of their defence, and their ability to take advantage of opportunities, which gave them the victory, so that the coach Peter Murchie had all the right to be happy.
“We have been tested in all matches and we have remained unbeaten, so I’m glad to be happy.
Robyn Christie, from the Melrose, said: “The Ayr deserved recognition, they took better advantage of opportunities than we did.”
The Grant Anderson try in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, put the Ayr ahead; but a yellow card to Rory Hughes, loaned from the Warriors for the game, allowed the Melrose to take advantage of the disadvantage of the opposition and Jason Baggot scored a try unconverted.
Clima extended the lead in the halftime scoreboard. Before halftime, he converted a penalty.
However, the Melrose started well in the second half and the Anderson's try reduced this lead to five points.
After a long break for a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who had to be carried off on a stretcher, and when the game resumed, Ayr led with a try by Stafford McDowall converted by Climo.
The yellow card to Blair Macpherson, captain of Ayr, allowed the Melrose to take advantage of having a man more with a converted try by Bruce Colvine, under enormous pressure.
However, the locals recovered and, when Struan Hutchinson was yellow carded for placing Climo without the ball, from the sideline, MacPherson scored a try when the maul was advancing.
Climate changed it, as it had been doing since the restart of the game, after Kyle Rowe received a pass from David Armstrong and sent Gregor Henry to the sideline to score the fifth try for the home side.
The protagonist in Still Game wants to turn his career towards the restaurant business.
Ford Kieran, the protagonist of Still Game, seems determined to enter the restaurant sector after discovering he has been appointed to a chain of restaurants.
The actor of 56 years, Jack Jarvis, is the star of the BBC's long-running comedy show, which he co-writes and co-stars with his long-time comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the ninth season will be the last of the series, and Kiernan is making plans for his life after Craiglang.
According to the official record, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the matter, but a source from the Scottish Sun reported that Kiernan was interested in the “booming” restaurant market in Glasgow.
“The sea belongs to us: a land without a coastline has the hope that the court will reopen the Pacific route.
Naval personnel guard a naval base in La Paz.
In public buildings, the blue flag is flown.
From the Titicaca to the Amazon, the naval bases display the motto: “The sea belongs to us by right,”
Reclaiming it is a duty.
In all Bolivia, a land without a sea, yet they still remember vividly the lost coastline to Chile in a bloody nineteenth-century dispute over resources, and the longing to return to navigating the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are the largest in decades, as Bolivia expects a decision from the International Court of Justice on October 1, after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the drive, a spirit of unity and serenity, and, of course, is waiting for the result with a positive vision.
Many Bolivians will watch the verdict of the International Court of Justice on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the court will rule in favor of Bolivia's claim that Chile has been in breach of its obligation to negotiate for decades to grant Bolivia a sea-level outlet to the Pacific.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who is running for re-election in 2009, also has a lot to say about the resolution on Monday.
We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean.
However, some analysts believe that the court will not decide in favor of Bolivia and that the situation would not change much if it did.
The UN organization with its headquarters in The Hague has no power to adjudicate Chilean territory and has stated that it will not be involved in any possible talks.
The fact that the International Court of Justice's decision came six months after the final arguments indicates that the case was not complicated, said Paz Zárate, a Chilean international law expert.
Far from promoting the cause of Bolivia, the last four years may have hindered it.
The problem of access to the sea has been seized upon by the current Bolivian administration.
He also suggested that the aggressive rhetoric of Morales has undermined any residual goodwill Chile had for Argentina.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to speak, but it will be difficult to have conversations after this.
The two countries did not exchange ambassadors since 1962.
The former president of Bolivia, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making was unusually quick.
Tuesday will offer Bolivia an opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile and the possibility of ending 139 years of disagreements with mutually benefiting benefits.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, was using the maritime issue as a political mule.
“Bolivia never gives up its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean”, he said.
The resolution is an opportunity to see that we have to leave behind the past.
North Korea says it will not disarm unless it can trust the United States.
Ri Yong Ho, Foreign Minister of North Korea, said that his country would never be the first to undertake nuclear disarmament if it could not trust Washington.
Mr. Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to fulfill the promises made at a summit in Singapore between the rivals.
Her remarks arrive at the right time when Mike Pompeo, secretary of State of the United States, appears to be about to restart nuclear talks with North Korea, which have been suspended for more than three months after this summit with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong U.
Ri said that continued sanctions and the opposition of the United States to a declaration that ends the Korean War to end the war in Korea is a “fantasy”.
Washington is suspicious of accepting the declaration without North Korea making any significant disarmament move.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want to hold a second summit.
However, there is a widespread scepticism about the sincerity of Pyongyang's willingness to give up its nuclear arsenal.
Pompeo is scheduled to visit Pyongyang in the coming month to prepare for the next summit between the leaders.
Paris Fashion Week shows the latest line of huge hats landing on a street near you.
If you want to add to your collection of hats or to protect yourself from the sun, don't look any further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a collection of large, eccentric hats for their spring/summer 2019 collection on the runway, shining the style of the Paris Fashion Week.
Sombreros impossible hats have flooded Instagram this summer and these designers have taken their spectacular creations to the runway.
The most remarkable piece of Valentino's was a beige hat with a wide brim adorned with feathers.
Other large accessories were orange with jewels, a magician's hat and even a pineapple, but they were not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a collection of strange masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn lips and resembled the look of Hannibal Lecter more than high fashion.
A diving suit, snorkel and diving goggles were created, while the other looked like a melted ice cream cone.
If you like the size fashion, you're lucky.
Predictions that huge hats could be seen in stores.
Big hats are making a strong return, with a hat made by “La Bomba”, with a 60 centimeter wing hat used by all, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The brand behind this hat that was so popular on social media presented yet another great creation on the runway: a beach bag as big as the model in swimsuit who was wearing it.
The rafia bag, decorated with white and brown string, was the main item in the La Riviera collection for the spring-summer 2019 Paris Fashion Week.
As Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I’m expecting huge beach hats and shopping bags in the street. 
’s summer, I’m sure the designer has had a big impact, and it would be difficult to ignore the demand for large accessories.
Language skills are fundamental for citizens of the world.
Scotland's independent schools have a long record of academic excellence that has continued in 2018 with another set of extraordinary results in the exams that is further enhanced by the successes of individuals and collectives in sport, art, music and other community projects.
With more than 30,000 students in all Scotland, these independent schools, represented by the Scottish Independent Schools Council (SISC, por sus siglas en inglés), are committed to delivering the best level of service to students and parents.
Independent schools are designed to prepare students for further study in higher education, to prepare them for the career they choose and for the place they will occupy in the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a curriculum, the modern languages are still popular and desirable in schools.
As Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, the message gets to his head.
If you speak in their language, you reach their heart.
This is a powerful reminder that if you want to establish relationships and build trust with people from other countries, you can't rely solely on English.
If we consider the recent results of the examinations, we can see that the languages are at the top of the tables, with the highest grades in the independent schools.
In total, 68% of students studying foreign languages achieved an A, the highest grade.
The data from 74 SCIS centres showed that 72 percent of students achieved an A in Chinese, while 72 percent of students achieved an A in German, 69 percent of students achieved an A in French and 63 percent of students achieved an A in Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a fundamental skill that children and young people will need in the future.
In the present day, languages are considered to be at the same level as the CTIM subjects in the curriculum of independent schools and elsewhere.
A survey carried out in 2014 by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills revealed that, of the reasons given by employers on the difficulties they encountered in recruiting staff, 17% were attributed to language skills.
Language skills are therefore becoming increasingly important for young people to prepare for their future careers.
The potential for employment opportunities that require languages are increasing, so these skills are essential for a globalized world.
Independent of the career someone chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future because of the language skills they will have learned, which will last for the rest of their lives.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will allow that person to be ahead of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4000 adult Britons in 2013, only 75% of them spoke no foreign language well enough to keep a conversation. 
&apos;s also established that only two percent spoke French as their first language.
This is why it is important to invest in language teaching now for children today.
If they know several languages, especially those of the developing economies, children will be better equipped to find a quality job.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Some centres will focus on the modern languages, while others will teach the most important languages for the United Kingdom by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the child's interests, in independent schools any child can choose from several languages taught by specialized teachers in this area.
Independent Scottish schools devote all their efforts to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equipped them with the skills necessary to succeed, whatever the future may hold.
In the current business environment, it is clear that languages are vital for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be considered international communication skills.
Independent schools will continue to offer these options, diversity and excellence to young Scots.
It is well to do it.
John Edward is the director of the Independent Scottish Schools Council.
LeBron James debuts with the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
The fans who have been waiting to see LeBron James make his first appearance with Los Angeles Lakers are about to end.
Luke Walton, coach of the Lakers, announced that James will play in the opening game of the preseason against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, it is still to be determined how long he will play.
“It will be more than one and less than 48,” said Walton on the official website of the Lakers.
The Lakers' reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that it was likely that James would play a few minutes.
After a training session at the beginning of this week, James was asked about his plans for the six-game preseason program for the Lakers.
In this stage of my career I don't need to play in preseason games to prepare myself.
It's the time for the Trump rally in West Virginia, YouTube
President Trump starts campaigning series of rallies in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five rallies planned by Trump for the next week, including stops in places with Trump supporters, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation of his candidate for the Supreme Court vacancy in the interim, Trump is attempting to secure support for the next mid-term election, as the Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when the votes are deposited in November.
What is the Trump rally in West Virginia and how to watch it online?
The Trump rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for Saturday, September 29th, 2018.
You can watch it online through a live stream on YouTube.
It is likely that Trump will comment on the appearances of this week of the nominee to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who was accused of sexual misconduct and has been delayed in a Senate vote for confirmation for as much as a week while the FBI investigates.
The main purpose of these rallies is to help Republican candidates who are facing elections in November to take off.
The campaign also pointed out that the five rallies are intended to “inspire volunteers and supporters while the GOP tries to protect and expand their majorities in the Senate and House of Representatives, according to Reuters.
“The control of Congress is so crucial to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible while campaigning,” said a campaign spokesman who declined to be named.
The rally is scheduled to be held at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling tonight, and could attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as having media coverage in the Pittsburgh media.
The Saturday after the election, Trump will be the second time in a month that he visits West Virginia, the state in which he won by more than 40 points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate from West Virginia, who is lagging in the polls.
“For Morrisey, it is a bad sign that the president had to push him up in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political science professor at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team shows that it is willing to fight to keep alive the hope of a successful individual game on Sunday.
After three singles matches, the foursomes on the final day of the Cup may be what this Ryder Cup needed.
The péndulo swinging concept is a completely invented sporting concept, but players believe in it, more so in competitions like these.
Then, where is the push now?
They were leading by six points and now they're four points behind, so I think that's a small push.
Europe has a clear advantage, of course: four points ahead with twelve more to play.
As Spieth points out, Americans feel that they have a little wind in their sails and have plenty of motive to be cheerful, among other reasons because Spieth and Thomas played together all day and scored three points each.
Spieth is deadly from the tee to the green and preaches with the example.
The loud yell of celebration rose in volume as the round progressed, introducing a vital putt to tie the game when Thomas and Goyard were two down after two holes.
The putt that gave them the win was received with a cry similar to that of the celebratory cheer, which means that the American team is still in the game.
“What to do is to redouble efforts and concentrate on the game.”
That is what they have done.
18 holes to leave a mark.
Only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable story of the Ryder Cup.
The odd couple of Europe has four of four and nothing can go wrong.
“Molinowood” was the only couple who did not bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and in the last nine holes of Friday morning.
That streak and the way it flows with the crowded audience clearly shows that these are the players to be beaten on Sunday, and that there will be no other players as popular as Fleetwood and Molinari to seal a possible European victory when the sun sets at Le Golf National.
Preferably, both at the same time in different holes.
Yet, though Europeans are still early in the game, they are not yet in the game.
Bubba Watson and Simpson sent Sergio García, the hero of the four-ball morning, to team with Noren.
A bogey and two double eagles buried the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole in which they could not escape.
But Sunday there will be no help for getting out of the holes.
The fourballs and foursomes are fascinating to watch because they are close-up and you can see the interactions between the pairs, the counsel they give and the counsel they don't give, and how a strategy can change in a moment.
Until now, Europe has played better as a team and has a great lead going into the final day, but this four-man session also showed that the U.S. team is willing to fight, something that some Americans, especially Americans, doubted.
Europe leads by 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe leads by a good margin the last day of the Ryder Cup, after the fourballs and foursomes have finished.
The motivated duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the contest with two wins over a Tiger Woods who was in trouble, leading by four points in the Le Golf National.
The European Thomas Bjorn, trying to retain the trophy that they lost in Hazeltine two years ago dominated an American team that made many errors during the fourballs of the morning, which ended 3-1.
The United States offered more resistance in foursomes, winning two matches, but did not shorten the gap.
The American Jim Furyk needs to win eight of the 12 singles matches on Sunday to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European to win four consecutive points. Molinari, who received the nickname of “Molliwood” after a stellar weekend, is the second pair to win four points in their four first matches in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, their formidable alliance served to beat Woods and Decahmbeau by a 5-4 score.
Woods, who in the two matches of the weekend had not been too impressive, had occasional bursts of brilliance, but now has lost 19 of his 29 fourballs and foursomes, and seven consecutive.
Justin Rose, who was rested for the morning fourballs, returned to being the partner of Henrik Stenson in the foursomes, beating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, number one and number three in the world respectively, with a score 2-1.
Although the day was a pleasant and calm day in the southwest of Paris, Europe was not on its side.
The three-time winner, Jordan Spieth, and Justin Thomas served as role models for Americans, earning two points on Sunday.
They achieved a stunning upset 2-1 over Ian Poulter and Jon Rahm in the fourballs and then defeated Poulter and McIlroy 4-3 in the foursomes after losing the first two holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, a team has recovered from a deficit of four points in the singles only twice, although Furyk, as the trophy holder, is only required to draw the match to retain it.
Although they have been the second best for two days, it appears that a counterattack on Sunday is beyond their capabilities.
North Korea says it is “not possible” to disarm unilaterally if it does not have confidence.
On Saturday, the Foreign Minister of North Korea reported to the UN that the continued sanctions were increasing North Korea's distrust of the United States and that there was no prospect of North Korea relinquishing its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho made a report to the General Assembly annual meeting of the United Nations that North Korea had taken “significant measures of goodwill” in the past year, such as stopping nuclear tests and missile tests, dismantling nuclear facilities and committing to nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament.
However, we did not receive any such response from the United States.
If we do not have faith in the United States, we cannot have faith in our national security, and, in that case, there is no possibility of us first unilaterally disarming ourselves.
Although Ri repeated the well-known complaints of North Korea against Washington's refusal to a “phased” denuclearization formula that rewards North Korea for steps it takes toward disarmament, his statement is important, as North Korea has not yet abandoned its refusal to negotiate a nuclear-weapons-free regime.
Ri made reference to a joint declaration by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump following the first North Korean leader-in-activity and a leader-in-waiting meeting in Singapore on June 12, 2018, when Kim committed to working for “the peaceful and complete disarmament of the Korean Peninsula” and Trump pledged to ensure North Korea's security.
North Korea has pursued the official end of the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States has said that North Korea must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to soften the international sanctions against North Korea.
The United States has insisted on nuclear disarmament first and has increased pressure by means of sanctions in order to achieve its purpose by force, even by obstructing a declaration of war.
The idea that sanctions can make us kneel is a fantasy of people who don't know us.
The problem is that continued sanctions deepen our distrust.
The UN Secretary-General did not mention any plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which was announced to the media with bombo and platerettes by the American leader at the United Nations.
Instead, the minister emphasized three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae-in, the leader of South Korea, in the last five months, and added: “If South Korea had been the party interested in the nuclear disarmament on the Korean Peninsula, rather than the United States, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula would not be in a stalemate like this.
Yet even so, the tone of the speech of the year past, when she said to the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to direct North Korean missiles toward American soil after the “evil” Trump, on a suicidal mission, called Kim “rocket man”.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who the year before threatened to “destroy totally” North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in pursuing the disarmament process, but said that much more work was still to be done and that it was necessary to continue to apply sanctions until North Korea was fully disarmed.
Trump said Wednesday that there was no time frame set for this: “We can take two, three or five years, no matter how long.
China and Russia allege that the United Nations Security Council should reward North Korea for its achievements.
However, as the secretary of State of the United States, Mike Pompeo, reported to the Security Council on Thursday, “the imposition of Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without default until we achieve a nuclear-weapons-free and fully verified nuclear-weapons-free and fully verified free of nuclear weapons.”
The Security Council has unanimously imposed sanctions on North Korea since 2006, in an attempt to cut funding to the country's nuclear and missile programs.
Pompeo spoke to Ri outside the United Nations General Assembly and subsequently commented that he would return to Pyongyang in a few weeks to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his latest trip was not a success.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, but, a few hours later, North Korea accused it of being a “mafia”.
In a meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-il in June, North Korea agreed to dismantle its nuclear weapons and nuclear facilities if the United States applied the appropriate measures.
He said that Kim had told him that Kim had told him that the “corresponding measures” he sought were those that Trump had promised in Singapore and steps toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Students from Harvard University are taking a course on how to sleep enough.
Thanks to a new course being offered at Harvard University this year, all students are now required to sleep more in an attempt to fight against the growing culture of studying all night drinking caffeine.
A professor discovered that students at the number one university in the world do not have much knowledge about basic care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard School of Medicine, and a specialist in the Brigham and Women's Hospital designed the course, which is believed to be the first of its kind in the United States.
His motivation to start the course arose after giving a talk on how sleep deprivation affects learning.
At the end of the semester, a girl approached me and asked me why I had learned this now, in my last year.
He said he had never heard of the importance of dreams, which surprised me.
The course, first offered this year, explains the basic concepts about how good sleep habits contribute to academic and sporting success, as well as improving overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a psychiatrist at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the medical services of the university, said the school decided to add the course after discovering that students were sleeping only during the week.
The course lasts one hour and includes a series of interactive tasks.
In a section, there is a bedroom with students clicking on cups of coffee, curtains, sporting shoes and books that inform them of the effects of caffeine and light, and the impact of lack of sleep on sporting performance and the importance of establishing a routine to go to bed.
In another section, participants are informed of how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Then, an interactive icon animation encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
We know that it won't change the students' behavior overnight.
However, we believe that they have the right to know it, as everyone else has the right to know the health effects of smoking tobacco.
He said that the culture of pride for “passing the night in bed” still exists and added that the modern technology and increasing pressure on students meant that the problem of sleep deprivation was growing.
Sleeping the right amount of time and a good quality sleep should be “the secret weapon” of students to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety; even to avoid gaining weight, as sleep deprivation makes the brain generate a sense of hunger, so they want to eat all the time.
Raymond So, a California-born 19-year-old who studied chemistry and physics, assisted Professor Czeisler in designing the course after having attended one of his classes the previous year during his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to broaden the course to all campus.
It is hoped that the next step will be to require all graduate students to complete a similar study program before they join the competitive institution.
The recommendation of Professor Czeisler is that students think of putting an alarm for bed and another for awakening, and be aware of the harmful effects of blue light from electronic devices and LEDs, which can disrupt circadian rhythms, so they would have trouble falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - Rangers 0: The goal by Menga knocks out the Rangers
The Rangers suffered a second episode of depression away from home, when the attack of Dolly Menga sent the disarticulated Steven Gerrard's squad to a 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
The Ibrox Boys wanted their first away win since February, but the team of Gary Holt beat the team of Alex Ferguson for the second time in 18 games as manager, leaving the Hearts top of the Premiership ladder.
The Menga attack took place at halftime and the Rangers' poor performance was not up to par at any time.
Now, the Rangers drop to sixth place, the Livingston rises to third place, behind the Hibernian by goal difference.
Maybe the Rangers will face more problems, as Calum Spence had to receive medical attention after a ball was thrown at him from the visitors' side of the field.
Gerrard made eight of the starting players who won the match against Ayr, entering the semi-finals of the Scottish League Cup.
In fact, Holt was pleased by the way his team dominated the Hearts in the week before, and would have been delighted by the way his team kept the opposition in check.
Maybe the Rangers had more possession, but the Livingston took better advantage of the ball when they had it.
They should have marked the two minutes mark when Menga made a pass to Scott Pittman, who was left unmarked in space, and left Allan McGregor alone in front of McGregor, but he passed the ball wide.
Keaghan Jacobs threw a deep free kick for captain Craig Halket, but Alan Lithgow could only manage to send it over the crossbar.
The Rangers regained control, but it seemed that there was more hope than conviction on their game in the last third.
It is clear that Alfredo Morelos felt that he had been penalised in the 15th minute of the game, when he and Steven Lawless collided, but the referee Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian's request for a penalty.
The Rangers scored two goals in the first half, but the former Ibrox keeper, Liam Kelly, was only in trouble to deal with the headed goal from Lassana Coulibaly and the unremarkable cross from Ovie Ejaria.
Although the goal scored in the 34th minute by the Livingston was a surprise, no one can deny that they deserved it for the hard work they put in.
Again, the Rangers could not handle a deep corner play by Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher scored for Scott Robinson, who kept calm and passed the ball to Menga who scored.
In the break, Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, which had an immediate impact, as Morelos passed the ball to Kelly, but Kelly was able to block him.
However, the Livingston still kept the visitors exactly where they wanted to go, with Lithgow and Halkett clearing a passing play after another.
The Holt brothers could have taken more advantage of the final stages, but McGregor stood firm to deny Jacobs before Lithgow headed a corner that did not enter.
The Rangers' replacement, Glen Middleton, claimed a penalty towards the end of the game after a collision with Jacobs, but again Thomson looked the other way.
The Geiger counter was invented by the inventor of the Geiger counter.
Now, a page from the Sunday Morning Almanac section: 30 September 1882, and counting... was born in Germany the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm Geiger.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, a discovery that culminated in the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter, which since then has become a symbol of science, also became a symbol of pop culture, as in the 1950 movie “The Bells of Coronado”, with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in the dual roles of scientists and cowboys:
Man: “What is this?”
Rogers: “A Geiger counter is used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on the headphones, you can hear the effect of the radioactive radiation emitted by minerals.
It's like a radio!
Hans Geiger died in 1945, when he was 63 years old.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” cancer cells.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” cancer cells and kill them.
As part of treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells.
The method requires the removal of immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory.
They can “see” a common protein in many cancers and reinject them.
A clinical trial of a vaccine is producing promising results in patients with different cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who taught the immune system to recognize malignant cells, saw her cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method requires the removal of immune cells from a patient and altering them in the lab to make them “see” a common protein found in many breast cancers, called HER2, and then reinjecting the cells.
The professor Jay Berzofsky, of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest that we have a promising vaccine.”
HER2 promotes the growth of different types of cancer, such as breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer or colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to taking immune cells from patients and teaching them to attack cancer cells has worked in treating a type of leukemia.
Kanye West took a stand in support of Trump with a MAGA hat after appearing on SNL.
It didn't work out.
Kanye West was booed on Saturday Night Live after a performance that was erratic and praised President Trump for his remarks and said he would run for president in 2020.
After the third song of the night, called Ghost Town, during which he wore the hat with the message Make America Great Again, he began to despise Democrats and reaffirmed his support for Trump.
Sometimes I talk to a white person and they ask me how I can like Trump if he is racist.
I don't care about racism, but I'd have left the U.S. long ago.
SNL started with a sketch of Matt Damon parodying the statement of Brett Kavanaugh before the Senate Judiciary Committee in relation to the Christine Blasey Ford assault allegations.
Although it was not broadcast, comedian Chris Rock uploaded the argument to YouTube.
It is not clear whether Rock was trying to ridicule West.
He also said he had been uncomfortable wearing the hat.
They went after me.
They told me to remove my hat.
They came at me!
And then they say I'm sleeping, according to the Washington Post.
West continued: “Do you want to see me asleep?” and added that he was going to put on his superman's coat, which meant that no one could tell him what to do. Do you want the world to move?
Try with love.
The comments received boos from the audience at least twice and SNL members seemed to be embarrassed, as reported by Variety. One person said: “The study was silent.
West was invited to replace Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many when he appeared on stage dressed as a bottle of Perrier.
West received the support of the conservative leader of the TPUSA group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: “One of the most courageous spirits: THANK YOU for resistance against the mob”.
Karen Hunter, a news anchor, tweeted that West was just being himself and that was absolutely wonderful.
But I do not award anyone (not buying their music or their clothes, or supporting their art) who I consider to be advocating a dangerous ideology for my community.
He is free.
We also.
Before the program, rapper Kanye West announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he was now known as “the person previously known as Kanye West”.
It is not the first artist to change his name, following the steps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague, Snoop Dogg has also been called Snoop Lion, without forgetting the legendary music legend, Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist previously known as Prince.
Attempted murder charge for stabbing in a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed to death in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, according to the police.
The accused is expected to appear in court on Monday.
The prosecution will review the charges.
Kit Harington, star of Game of Thrones, attacks toxic masculinity.
Kit Harington is famous for his role as Jon Snow in the violent fantasy drama series of the HBO, Game of Thrones.
The actor, 31, has attacked the stereotype of the male action hero, saying that those roles in film often transmitted to young men that they had to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit commented that he believes something has gone wrong and asked how to address the issue of toxic masculinity in the era of #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones costar Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he finds it “very important” to address this issue.
I think it is important for us to look at what we have done wrong with masculinity.
What have we been teaching men while they were growing up, thinking about the problems that are now?
Kit believes that television can have a part of the responsibility for the toxic masculinity due to the characters in the show being so masculine.
What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on television, and on the street, that makes them feel that they have to be this particular kind of man?
I think that that is one of the great questions of our time. How do we change it?
Because it is clear that something has gone wrong with the education of young people.
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in any prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones when the series concludes in summer, saying he was “tired of battles and horses”.
From November, Kit will star in True West, the Sam Shepard play that tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
He recently revealed that he believes that meeting his wife Rose is the best thing he has gotten out of Game of Thrones.
I met my wife on the show, so I have my future family and my life from now on.
Rose was the love interest of Jon Snow, the main character in the fantasy drama series "Game of Thrones".
The couple married in June 2018 in a family farm in Scotland.
VIH/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced an increase of 14% in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820,000 people affected, according to the health authorities.
Between the second and third quarters of 2018, there were 40,000 new cases.
Most of these were contracted through sexual transmission, which is a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread quickly in some parts of China as a result of transfusions of blood infected with HIV.
However, the number of people who contracted HIV from this practice has been reduced to a large extent, as authorities in China's Yunnan province have stated at a conference on HIV/AIDS.
Each year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increases by 100,000 people.
HIV transmission by sexual intercourse is a serious problem in the gay community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but the LGBT community still suffers discrimination.
Because of the conservative values of the country, studies have calculated that between 70 % and 90 % of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the diseases are spread through unprotected sex.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged to make HIV medication available to all.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of her staff leaked any senator's personal information and asserts that the allegations are “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories.”
Representative Maxine Waters criticized the allegation that a member of her staff had published personal information of three Republican senators on Wikipedia pages about legislators.
The Democratic Party candidate for Los Angeles County Supervisor, Jan Perry, said the allegations were being made by conservative commentators and right-wing sites.
“Lies, lies and more lies”, said Waters on Twitter.
The information published included the addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham, from South Carolina, and Mike Lee, from Utah.
On Thursday, an unknown person from the Capitol published the information on the Internet during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on the allegations of sexual misconduct against Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court.
The leak occurred sometime after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identified the source of the publications was associated with Waters' office, and made public the personal details of a Waters employee.
This accusation is completely false and a complete lie.
The member of my personal whose personal data, security, and privacy have been affected as a result of these false allegations and false information leak was not the source of this information.
This allegation is completely false and a complete lie.
The Waters declaration sparked immediate criticism on the Internet, including that of former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.
“Disprove this information with anger”, wrote Fleischer.
This suggests that temperance is not necessary to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he did not do, he should not be angry.
Do not rebel.
Do not question the motives of the accuser.
You should be calm and serene.
It seems that Fleischer was comparing the reaction of Waters to the criticism of Justice Kavanaugh, who was accused of being too angry during his testimony on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is running against Waters for the half-term election, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
If it is true, it is very serious.
In his statement, Waters said that his office had warned the appropriate authorities and enforcement agencies of these fraudulent allegations.
We will ensure that the perpetrators are discovered, and that they are legally held accountable for all these destructive and dangerous acts.
The movie Johnny English: Back in Action is a funny parody of the James Bond movie series.
Now it has become a tradition to look for a British twist in any new British action comedy film.
Is this satirical parody of us being the new opportunity for export of the nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with his big-eyed, silly-faced, and expressionless face, has renewed his license for the second time. Only his name already gives hints that, more than anything else, he is a comic creation designed for English-speaking territories.
It is the ridiculous agent secret who, despite his strange pretensions of glamour, has a little bit of Clouseau, a touch of Mr. Bean and a smattering of that guy who played a note in the Carros de fuego theme at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympics.
In addition, the original inspiration for the mysterious travelling man was the international man of mystery represented by Atkinson in the long-forgotten television commercials for Barclayscard, who brought chaos after him.
In this last chapter, there are two or three good moments.
I loved watching Johnny English approach a medieval helicopter while the helicopter's rotor blades collided with the ship's hull.
The Atkinson gift for physical comedy is clearly visible, but the humour is rather short and isn't particularly funny, especially now that franchises like James Bond and Mission: Impossible add comedic elements without problems.
The humour seems more directed at children than at adults and, for me, the absurd adventures of Johnny English are not as funny and clever as the Mr. Bean jokes in the Mr. Bean persona.
Now the repeated argument is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A computer hacker has infiltrated the super-secret spy network of Britain, revealing the identities of all its active agents in service to the sadly under-performing agent in service, a small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the drop that tips the glass for the first minister, a pompous and worn-out character who is seeing how her popularity is sinking: Emma Thompson delivers her best performance as this character that is almost like Theresa May, but the script doesn't allow much room for working.
His intelligence advisers inform him that, as all active spies are in danger, he will have to call on a retired spy.
That has to be the dumb Johnny English, who now teaches in a private school, although there are some funny jokes, as Johnny is a spy school like the one in the movie School of rock.
English is taken to Whitehall for an urgent meeting and meets his former compinche Bough, played by Ben Miller again.
Now, Bough is a married man with a submarine captain, a sympathetic role for which he is not fully appreciated.
So, the Batman and Robin who do things terribly wrong in the Secret Service of His Majesty's Men return to action, with the beautiful woman fatal Ophelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the first minister is falling into the dangerous hands of a charming multimillionaire of the technology who claims to be able to solve the computer problems of Britain: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their absurd adventures: they disguise themselves as waiters, set fire to a French elegant restaurant, unleash chaos on the luxury yacht of Volta, and also try to use a virtual reality helmet to familiarise themselves with the interior of Volta's house.
Finally, they definitely put in the last stretch, but, by very loud and loud, the whole thing still sounds a bit childish.
A fairly regular product.
Like the other films in the series, I couldn't help but wonder if the British film industry could give Rowan Atkinson a role that truly appreciates his talent.
The Labour Party denies that it is planning to introduce a weekly four-day work week, but will instead pay workers five days a week.
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbyn is planning a radical plan that British workers would work four days a week, but would be paid five.
It is supposed that the party wants employers to allocate savings from the AI revolution to workers, giving them a day off.
The employees would enjoy three consecutive days off for the same pay.
According to sources, the idea would fit into the economic plans and agenda of the party's policy of aligning the country with workers.
This change to a week of four days has received the support of the Trade Union Congress, as it is a way for workers to benefit from the changing economy.
As a senior Labour Party official told The Sunday Times: A review of the directive is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
It is not possible to achieve this in one day, but the four-day work week is definitely a matter that the party hopes to incorporate into its economic strategy in favor of the worker, as well as in the overall industrial strategy of the party.
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this type of ideas, as the Green Party had already pledged a four-day work week in its campaign for the 2017 general election.
However, the Labour Party has not yet taken a position on the issue.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "The four-day week is not part of the party's policy and it is not being discussed at this time".
The Shadow Treasury Minister, John McDonnell, used the Labour Party conference last week to present his idea of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was willing to take back powers from anonymous directors and "squeezebox" managers who controlled public utilities.
Among the plans of the shadow minister also includes the idea that current shareholders of water companies do not recover their investment, as a government of the Labour Party could apply deductions that reflected the irregularities perceived.
He also confirmed his intention to include workers on the boards of directors of the private sector companies and create inclusive ownership funds in which 10 % of the shares of the private sector companies should be held by employees, which would result in annual dividends of up to £500 per person.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy discuss the FBI's investigation of Brett Kavanaugh and if it could change their minds.
The FBI investigation of the allegations made against Judge Kavanaugh has delayed at least a week the final vote on his confirmation as a justice of the Supreme Court and raises the question of whether the results of that investigation might influence a Republican senator who might decide to withdraw his support.
In an interview to be aired Sunday, "60 Minutes" journalist Scott Pelley asks two Republican Senators, John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, if the FBI could be used to change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
Yes, of course, Mr. Kennedy.
I was in favor of the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after all this had happened, after I had made the allegation and asked him: 'Did you do it?'
He was firm, resolute, and uncompromising.
Graham's vote, however, seems unchangeable.
I have already made a decision on Kavanaugh and would overlook the allegation.
"Dra. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it tautly.
No one of the people she named has been able to confirm it.
It was 36 years ago.
It's always the same, no matter what the case.
What is the "Global Citizen Festival"? What has it accomplished in reducing poverty?
This year's Global Citizen Festival will be held in New York City on Saturday, and will feature a stellar lineup of international stars, who are also committed to a mission to end poverty in the world.
This year, in its seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will see hundreds of thousands of people move to the Great Lawn of Central Park to enjoy performances by Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of the event: to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international awareness-raising group that aims to end poverty by raising the number of people who actively fight against poverty.
If you want to receive a free ticket to the event (unless you can afford a VIP ticket), the concert-goers have had to complete a series of tasks or “actions”, such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call or any other thing that serves to educate about your goal of ending poverty.
However, what has the Global Citizen achieved in 12 years of being in operation?
Doing a free concert is a genuine way to persuade people to take action or is it just a form of the "clicktivismo", which is the belief that we are really making something really useful by signing a petition online or tweeting?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have registered more than 19 million "acts" of its supporters in favor of a number of diverse objectives.
Thanks to these actions, they have been able to announce commitments and policies for more than $37 billion, which will benefit more than 2250 million people by 2030.
In 2018, the group had 390 commitments and announcements that arose from their actions, of which, at least 10 billion US dollars had been raised or spent.
The group estimates that the guaranteed funds have had a direct impact on 649 million people in all over the world.
Among the most important commitments is "The Power of Nutrition", a partnership of investors and implementers with headquarters in the UK, and the common goal of helping children grow and develop with all their potential. With this end in mind, they have proposed to provide Rwanda with 35 million $ to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4700 tweets from Global Citizens.
Thanks to the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can mark a small historic milestone in the history of social injustice of malnutrition.
The group also claimed that, after having carried out more than 5000 actions to improve nutrition in the United Kingdom for mothers and children, the government announced the financing of a project, Power of Nutrition, with which 5 million women and children will benefit from nutrition interventions.
We respond to a common question that is frequently asked on your site about what we believe we can do to address extreme poverty.
A Global Citizen collaborator responded: "It will be a long and difficult road and, at times, we will fall and we will be upset.
But as they have already achieved previous movements in favour of human rights and against apartheid, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are some of the acts we will be hosting in New York this year, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy to block exports of Russian energy resources - Interior Secretary's Office
"In the event of necessary action, Washington could call on its Navy to prevent Russian energy from shaking the markets, including the Middle East, revealed Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke, according to a report in the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that the alliance between Russia and Syria, in particular where it operates on the basis of the legitimate government, is merely a pretext for expansion into new markets.
I am convinced that they are in the Middle East to negotiate with energy, as they do with Eastern Europe, becoming the supplier of energy to the south of Europe.
In addition, according to official reports, there are methods and ways to deal with this issue.
"United States, with its Navy, has the capacity to guarantee that the seaways remain open and, if necessary, could even block them to ensure that energy does not end up in the market.
Zinke spoke to people who attended a conference organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that is described as the "voice of the consumer energy" in the United States.
In it, he compared the approaches Washington takes to its negotiations with Russia and Iran, and warned that they are, in fact, the same.
The economic alternatives in Iran and Russia are, essentially, to replace and reuse fossil fuels.
These assertions are made when the Trump administration has been trying to export natural gas to Europe and to relieve Russia of its role as the cheapest source of natural gas for European consumers.
To do so, the administration Trump, including the very own Donald Trump, have been trying to persuade Germany to abandon the unprofitable Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which, according to Trump, will keep Berlin as a hostage to Moscow.
Moscow has consistently insisted on the gas pipeline Nord Stream 2, which is valued at 11 billion $ and is intended to double the capacity of the current gas pipeline to 110 billion m3, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin denies that Washington's opposition to the project is solely economic and is a sign of competition.
I believe that energy cannot be used as a tool of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers.
The American position has, however, met with opposition from Germany, who has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The German industry leader, the Bundesverband der Industrie (BDI), has asked the U.S. not to intervene in European energy policy or in bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
It is a major problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply, said Dieter Kempf, director of the German Industry Federation (BDI) after a recent meeting between the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Senator Warren will analyze the possibility of running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren
Senator Warren said she would consider running for president after the midterm elections.
During a press conference in the City of Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering this challenge.
It is time for women to get to Washington to mend our broken government and to have women sit on the board of directors for the first time.
After the 6th November, I will seriously consider running for president.
Warren gave his opinion on President Donald Trump during a public hearing and stated that he was "saying the wrong thing".
I'm concerned about the damage Donald Trump is doing to our democracy.
Warren was uncompromising in his criticism of Trump and his nominee for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On a tweet Friday, Warren said that "it is absolutely necessary that the FBI investigate what happened before the vote".
The poll was published on Thursday, but a majority of Warren's own voters believe he should not run for re-election in 2020.
A 58% of Massachusetts "possible" voters said that Senator Clinton should not run, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
A 32% of those polled supported his candidacy.
In the survey, the former governor, Deval Patrick, received a 38% of support and a 48% of opposition.
Other members of the Democratic Party spoke about the possible candidacy for the 2020 presidential election of former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would announce his decision officially in January, as reported by the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about the posttraumatic stress disorder of Track Palin at a rally for Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, served in Iraq for a year after enlisting in September.
The arrest and prosecution of domestic violence offender was made on Monday last night.
"My son's situation is well known to the other families who have suffered the effects of posttraumatic stress disorder and other injuries sustained by our soldiers", said the crowd at a pro-Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin referred to this as the great taboo of which no one wants to speak, and commented on his son and other veterans of war who "turned out with a different attitude, hardened, asking if there really is any respect for what their fellow soldiers and airmen, as well as all the other members of the army, have given to their country.
Monday he was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, charged with a domestic violence incident that interferes with a domestic violence complaint and possession of drugs or alcohol while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla police department.
18 states, D.C. support the challenge to revise the current refugee policy.
18 states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to the new United States policy that denies asylum to victims of domestic violence or gang violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the district wrote a letter "amicable" on Friday to show their support for a refugee applicant who is facing the current immigration policy, reported NBC News.
The plaintiff's name has not been revealed in the case "Grace v. Sessions" that was filed in August by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU, American Civil Liberties Union) against federal policy.
He said that his partner "and his children, who are members of a violent street gang", abused her, but the US officials denied her asylum request on 20 July.
He was arrested in Texas.
The lawyers who represent these states that defend Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum applications to the United States, as nations that face generalized problems related to domestic violence and gang violence.
The new asylum policy of the United States reversed a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) that had removed the right of undocumented immigrants to seek asylum in this country.
The District of Columbia's Attorney General, Karl Racine, made a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of international law, state and federal law".
According to federal law, all asylum applications must be decided on the facts and circumstances of the particular case and this exception violates that principle.
The law also discourages the entry of immigrants, which they said was counterproductive to the economy of the United States as immigrants tend to become entrepreneurs more frequently and become a "needed workforce".
The United States Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims of domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
"Asylum seekers can apply for asylum if they leave their home countries for reasons of persecution or threat by race, religion, nationality or political opinion, or for membership in a particular social or political group," Sessions said when announcing the directive on June 11.
Asylum never was created as a measure to address all the problems, nor even all the problems that people face daily in the world.
Desperate efforts to rescue survivors as the number of dead rises as the search for survivors continues.
For survivors, the situation was getting worse and worse.
"The situation is very tense", Mrs. Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told us as she tried to comfort her baby with fever in a shelter in the devastated city of Palu.
Each minute ambulances bring in more bodies.
The water supply is scarce.
Some residents have returned to their homes destroyed to rebuild their damaged possessions and to search through the few remaining belongings that they can salvage in an effort to recover as much as possible.
There are hundreds of injured people and hospitals are also overwhelmed by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
Some of the injured; among them, Dwi Haris, who has a broken back and a shoulder, lay outside the Army Hospital in Palu, where patients were being treated outside the building because of the continuous earthquakes, also very strong.
He could not stop crying when he told me about the violent earthquake he had while he was in the 5th floor of a hotel with his wife and his daughter.
We didn't have time to get away.
I was trapped in the ruins of the wall that had been blown up, I said, and I and my family were there to celebrate a wedding.
I heard my wife ask help and then a deep silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope you're all well.
The U.S. Ambassador accuses China of bullying with "propaganda ads"
A week after a Chinese official newspaper published a four-page advertisement in a U.S. daily newspaper promoting the benefits of trade between the U.S. and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to disseminate its propaganda.
On Wednesday, President Trump referred to the China Daily's supplementary payment in the Des Moines Register, the largest-selling newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of trying to interfere in the upcoming election to the United States Congress.
The accusation that Trump made against China for trying to influence the U.S. elections marked what officials in the U.S. indicated as a new phase in a campaign by Washington to pressure China.
Governments of foreign countries are common for them to publish advertisements to promote their commercial activities, but Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a growing trade war that has led to increasingly high tariffs on both sides.
The trade tariffs that were applied at the beginning of the trade war were designed to fall on the shoulders of exporters like Iowa, which supported the Republican Party of Trump, according to experts from both sides.
Terry Branstad, the former U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, said that Beijing had harmed American farmers, workers and businesses by blocking exports of agricultural products to China.
According to Branstad in an opinion piece in the Des Moines Register Sunday, China is intensifying its pressure on the press by publishing ads in our free press.
To spread its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the American tradition of free speech and press freedom to try to publish an advertisement in the Des Moines Register.
In contrast, in Beijing's street corner where we are here, there are only a few dissenting voices and no reflection of the disparate opinions that the Chinese people have on the troubling trajectory of their country's economy, as the media is firmly under the pressure of the Communist Party of China.
He added that one of China's most prominent newspapers refused to publish his article, but did not specify which newspaper.
Analysts say Republicans are retreating from women before the midterm election with the collapse of Kavanaugh.
As many Republicans of renown are closing ranks behind Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of the numerous allegations of sexual assault against him, and experts warn that a backlash may occur as women vote in the next mid-term election.
The emotions surrounding this event have been very intense and many Republicans have expressed their desire to continue the vote.
"In this type of issues, there is no turning back", said Grant Reeher, a political science professor at the Maxwell School of the University of Siracuse, in an article that was published on Saturday.
Reeher doubted that Senator Flake's (R-Arizona) last attempt to support the FBI's investigation would be enough to calm voters dissatisfied with this issue.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday; they won't forget it in November, and they won't forget it in November", said Ms. Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and national spokesperson for the progressive MoveOn, as reported by the Washington, D.C.
The protesters chanted "November is coming!" (¡noviembre llegará pronto!) as the Republicans in the Judiciary Committee voted to proceed with the nomination of Kavanaugh, despite the testimony of Christine Blasey Ford, according to the Mic.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are out of all expectations," said Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst.
"The impact is already very significant, and, in fact, so is.
But it could be even greater, especially among women in the outer suburbs and among young women who are 18 to 29 years old, who tend to vote but don't like the president.
Even before the public testimony of Ford, which detailed his allegations of sexual abuse against the candidate for the Supreme Court, analysts said a backlash could occur if the Republicans went ahead with confirmation.
This issue has become a major political issue for the Republican Party, said former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele, according to NBC News.
"It's not just a vote on the committee or the final vote, it's also about the way the Republicans have handled it and how they've treated her, and how they've treated her, and how they've treated her.
However, the Americans seem to be divided; they do not know who to believe after the Ford and Kavanaugh testimonies, but there are a few more who are on the side of this last.
In a new YouGov poll, 41% of respondents believe the Ford testimony definitively or probably, while 35% believe the Kavanaugh testimony definitively or probably.
In addition, 38% of those surveyed said that they believed Kavanaugh had lied during his testimony, while 30% said the same of Ford.
After Flake's push, the FBI is investigating the allegations made by Ford, and, at least, those of another victim, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week and indicated that Kavanaugh raped her when she was 17 years old.
Ramírez claimed that the candidate for the Supreme Court showed his genitals at a party when he was studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a new company to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt is the last project of the legendary technology legend, a company that is based on the open-source platform Solid of the late Sir Tim Berners-Lee.
Solid supports users choosing where to store their data and who will have access to that data.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokingly said that the intention behind Inrupt was to "dominate the world".
It's got to be now, said he.
It's a historic moment.
The application uses Solid technology to enable users to create their own "online personal data warehouse" or POD.
It can contain tasks, task lists, calendars, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It is like if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available in a browser and at the same time.
One thing that is unique about online storage is that the user is who decides who can access what type of information.
The company calls it "personal training through data".
The idea of Inrupt, according to the company's general director, John Bruce, is to incorporate resources, processes and skills needed to reach everyone.
The company is currently formed by Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform that IBM purchased, some of the developers who were hired to work on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, developers of technology around the world could create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team were not talking to Facebook and Google about whether to introduce or not a radical change in their business models at once.
We won't ask permission.
In a Medium post on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote about Inrupt, "his mission is to provide commercial power and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web created in Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last few months, Tim Berners-Lee has had a very influential role in the debate over net neutrality.
Even though Inrupt is being launched, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
I'm extremely optimistic about the next web era.
Bernard Vann: the priest who won a Victoria Cross in the First World War
The only clergyman of the Church of England to win a Victoria Cross during the First World War was honoured 100 years after the event.
The Reverend Bernard Vann received this award on September 29, 1918, in the attack of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, a sniper shot him four days later and never knew that he had been awarded the highest military honour in Britain.
On Saturday, their two grandchildren discovered a commemorative stone in a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of them, Michael Vann, said that it was "a special symbolic significance" that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after the battle that earned his grandfather the award.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the St Quentin Canal "through a dense fog and under the intense fire of artillery and guns".
After running to the front line and with the greatest courage, he made the advance to the front line before reaching a single cannon with one hand and downing three of the detachment.
Colonel Vann was killed by a sniper on 4 October 1918, just one month after the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "so great that I can never reach his height, but they were very alerting.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid a wreath after the parade, which was attended by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "it was a great privilege for him to be part of the parade" and added that "the value of a real hero is shown when a large number of people support him".
The MMA fans were on guard all night for Bellator 206, but only saw Peppa Pig.
Imagine you're all night awake to see the Bellator 206 to see the main event.
The San Jose Cartel had 13 fights, six of which were included in the card's main card, and in the United Kingdom it was to be televised live on Channel 5.
At 6am, when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were about to fight, the viewers in the UK were stunned when the programme changed to Peppa Pig.
Some did not surprise themselves after having to stay up all night just to see the fight.
A Twitter follower described the change to cartoons as "a joke that's been a bit of a joke".
There is a government regulation that governs the content that is broadcast from 6 am and this wasn't appropriate, so they had to change to the programming for children.
"Peppa the Pig", yes.
Bellator president Scott Coker said the company would be changing the program to include British viewers in future editions.
When I think about the option of live broadcasting, I think it can work.
But it is 6 a.m. on Sunday, so we couldn't do it until Monday at our time, which would be Monday for them.
We are seeing how to do it.
When the programming was changed, a great deal of messages were received, and not all were friendly, precisely.
We tried to fix it, because we thought it was a technical problem.
But it was not a government problem.
I promise you that the next time it won't happen.
We will reduce it to five fights instead of six, which is the usual number we have offered. We tried to offer more than usual to make the fans happy and we passed.
It is a very unfortunate situation.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley was uncomfortable about his sexuality.
Olympic champion Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to the rest because of his sexuality, but this was, in turn, what motivated him to become a champion.
At 24, he told us he didn't realize until he reached high school that "not all were like me".
In the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs programme, presented by Lauren Laverne, she said her intention was to convey "hope" to others.
He also told us that becoming a father made him stop paying attention to the fact that he won the Olympics.
The host of the long-running BBC programme, Kirsty Young, is absent for a few months with illness.
In the first Laverne program, Daley, who was shown to himself as a marginal, commented that he felt "inferior" as a child because "nothing else was accepted socially that you liked children and children".
He said: "I have always felt inferiority and being different has been what has given me the power and strength to succeed".
He wanted to prove that he was something, so he didn't disappoint when he finally discovered his sexuality.
The winner of two bronze medals at the Olympics has become a prominent figure in the LGBT movement and his image has been used in the Commonwealth Games celebrated in Australia this year to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he told it because he was happy to live in freedom, without retribution, and he wanted to pass on that hope to others.
The three-time world champion also said that he was surprised to fall in love with a man, the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married in the year before, and he's married to a winner of an Oscar, who is 20 years older than him, but he said that age never had been a problem.
When you live so much from so young, it's hard to find someone of the same age who has gone through the same highs and lows as you.
The couple had a son in June who was named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said his perspective had changed.
If I had been asked a year ago, all the answers would have been 'I have to win a gold medal' answers.
But there are things more important than the gold medals of the Olympics.
My Olympic gold medal is, without a doubt, Robbie.
His son is called Robert, like his father, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was going to die and, in fact, one of the last things he asked was if they had the passes for London 2012, because he wanted to be in the front row.
I was unable to tell him I could not be in the front row.
He had his hand between mine's and when he stopped breathing and it was only then that I realized he wasn't invincible.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"In that moment I knew that that was what I had dreamed of all my life: competing in the pool with my family in the Olympics, it wasn't a bad thing at all.
This was also the fact that inspired him to choose his first song, Proud, by Heather Small, which he listened to during the preparation phase for the Olympic Games.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, in poor form, was left on the bench for the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
Phil Mickelson will play his 47th Ryder Cup game on Sunday, but he will have to reverse his form if he wants to avoid becoming a sad tale.
Mickelson, who was playing in the event that is held every two years to set a record for 12th time, was desbanked by Furyk for the fourballs and foursomes on the Saturday.
Instead of being in the center of the action, as many times he has been, the five-time major champion had to conform to the role of a spectator and, in other moments, to perfecting his game on the course and then to rectifying the affliction that troubles him.
Never the most direct of drivers, even in his peak years, the player is not in his best shape for the National Golf Club, where the rough long grass is constantly punishing with missed shots.
And if the field is not enough to discourage you, Mickelson will face the brilliant champion of the British Open, Francesco Molinari, who has joined Tommy Fleetwood to win the four matches they have played this week.
If the Americans, who were four points behind at the start of the 12-match series, had started the match with a stunning comeback, the Mickelson match could have been decisive.
Furyk showed confidence in his partner, but could say little more.
"He understood perfectly what he was doing today, and he gave me a palm on the back and said he would be ready tomorrow.
He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is in the Hall of Fame and has made a lot of contributions to these teams before and this week.
Probably I wouldn't have thought I'd be playing two games.
I thought there would be more, but that's how it came out and that's how we thought it should be.
He wants to be there, like the rest.
On Sunday, Mickelson will surpass the record of Nick Faldo for most Ryder Cup matches played by a player.
It could be the last of a long line of Ryder Cups that had never matched the level of his individual career.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and 7 ties, although Furyk said that his presence added many more intangibles to the team.
He is funny, sarcastic, satirical, and enjoys mocking others; he is great to have him on the team.
I think the younger players have enjoyed having him as a support, too.
It is a lot more than just fun.
The European captain, Thomas Bjorn, knows that leadership will soon disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows very well that, although you have a substantial lead in the last days of the Ryder Cup, you can easily become a challenging tournament.
The Danish made its debut in the 1997 Valderrama Open, where a Seve Ballesteros-led band of American players was leading by five points, but at the end of the day they only managed to finish with the other side just ahead by a narrow margin of 14½-13½.
"We're always reminding you that we won a great tournament in Valderrama; we also did it in Brookline and we won, but by a little margin, and we did it in Valderrama and we won, but by a little margin.
The history will show us to me and to everyone else that that team is not finished.
You have to give it all tomorrow.
Go out there and do what you have to do.
This is not over until the scores are up.
We have a goal to achieve, which is to win this trophy, and that is all we have to think about.
I say it all the time, I'm always talking about the 12 players on our team, but I'm also aware of what's going on on the other side where they are, not far behind the best players in the world.
Proud of what they have done their golfers on a very difficult course, Bjorn said: "I don't want to be ahead of myself."
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
What is prevalent tomorrow is individual performances and this is different.
It's great to share what's going on with a partner when things are going well, but when you're alone you put a lot of pressure on yourself.
That is the message to be conveyed to players, to extract the best of oneself tomorrow.
Now it is time to let your partner go, and to do your best.
In front of Bjorn, his homólogo Jim Furyk will try to make his players better individually than they did as a pair, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who each added three points from four.
The same Furyk has been in both extremes in the last two of those big tournaments and has been part of the team that won in Brookline and then lost when Europe took to the "Miracle of Medinah".
I remember every word, he said when we asked him how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, was able to motivate his players on the last day.
We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we have to start as strong as we did in Brookline, as you saw in Medinah.
When all progressed in the same direction, the pressure fell on the middle parties.
We defined our strategy and we made them feel that we were going to do something magical tomorrow.
We gave Thomas the task of leading the fight and facing Rory McIlroy in the main event, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other European players in the second half of the list.
I chose this group of boys because I think they cover the whole course.
The new German warship, delayed again.
The new German Navy frigate should have been completed in 2014 to replace the old ships of the Cold War era, but it will not be until at least the year that comes because of defective systems and the increasingly progressive cost, reported local media.
The delivery of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the lead ship of the new Baden-Württemberg class frigates, has been delayed until the first half of 2019, according to a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to have joined the Navy in 2014, but problems arose after the ship was delivered and the project was delayed.
The four ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class that the Navy requested in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
We know that they will include a powerful cannon, a battery of anti-aircraft missiles and anti-ship missiles, as well as some techniques of invisibility, such as radar, infrared, and acoustic signals.
Other important characteristics include longer maintenance periods, so that they can be deployed for up to two years away from the ports of origin.
However, delays have caused the ships to be outdated when they finally start service, according to Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 frigate occupied headlines last year when the German Navy refused to put the ship into service and returned it to Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
It was the first time that a ship had been returned to a shipyard after being delivered.
Little was known about the reasons behind the return, but the German media cited a number of "software and hardware defects" that made the ship virtually useless if sent on a combat mission.
Software deficiencies were particularly important, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships will be operated by a crew of 120 sailors: half the number of sailors in the former Bremen class frigates.
It was also determined that the ship is overweight, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the Navy to add future upgrades.
It is believed that the "Rheinland-Pfalz" is twice as heavy as other similar ships that were used by the Germans in World War II.
The hardware was also defective, and the project's cost has also been a problem.
It is believed that the value of the economy has reached € 31,000 million ($ 40,000 million), instead of the € 2200 million ($ 3,000 million) originally reported.
The problems that are attributed to the new frigates are of special relevance to light of the recent warnings on the reduction of naval power in Germany.
In the first half of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defense committee of the German parliament, recognized that the navy was "struggling to deploy ships that can be deployed".
The official said that the problem has been worsening over time, because old ships were retired, but not replaced with new ones.
He lamented that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates had been able to join the Navy.
The National Trust spy on the secret lives of bats.
This new study, which has been carried out in a Highland state, is attempting to discover how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
It is hoped that what is discovered will shed light on the only flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study, carried out by the National Trust for Scotland, will follow the common bat and Daubenton's bat, as well as the brown long-eared bat of Inverewe Gardens in Ross and Cromarty.
Special bat detectors will be placed in strategic locations in the property to track bat activity during the breeding season.
The volunteers and NHS staff will also deploy mobile detectors.
Scientists will analyze the sounds captured in the recordings to discover the frequency of calls from bats and what species they call.
The report and map will then be created to create a detailed image of the environment and its behaviour.
Rob Dewar, a conservation consultant for NTS, expects the results to reveal which areas of habitat are most important for bats and how they use them each species.
This information will be used to determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of grasslands and how to maintain forests for bat species and other associated species.
The populations of bats in Scotland and the United Kingdom have been greatly reduced in the last century.
They are under threat from construction and development that affects their nests and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and electrical wiring can also be a threat to them, as are insecticide and other chemical treatments of construction materials or attacks by domestic cats.
Mice are not blind.
But night-hunting is more useful than day-hunting for their hunting goals.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique that locates ants and obstacles in their flight path.
The National Trust, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 acres of land in all of South Africa, takes the bat-related topic seriously.
It has ten trained experts who carry out regular surveys, inspections of nests and, occasionally, rescues.
The organization has even opened the first and only reserve dedicated to Scotland's bat species in the state of Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten species of Scotland's bat.
David Thompson, the property director, says the land is ideal for them.
Here, in Threave, we have a fantastic bat roost.
We have old buildings, many mature trees, and the right habitat.
However, there are still many things that are unknown about bats, so our work here and elsewhere will help us to better understand what they need to develop.
Reassures that it is important to check for bats before undertaking maintenance work in properties, as they can destroy the nesting colonies and kill 400 pups and babies, which would result in the destruction of a whole local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, harass them, or harass their colonies.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish official of the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to help.
He said: "We still have much to learn about bats and many other species on which we do not yet know how their populations evolve".
Ronaldo denies the allegations of rape while his lawyers pursue the German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo has denounced the allegations of rape as "fake news", and says that people want to be known by their name.
His lawyers have been instructed to sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the interview.
The Portuguese forward and Juventus midfielder is accused of raping a woman called Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He was accused of paying 375,000 $ to hide the incident, as reported by Der Spiegel on Friday.
With an Instagram Live video that has already amassed 142 million followers a few hours after the news was published, Ronaldo, 33, tackled the report as "fake news".
No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false, he says.
They want only to get paid for their name.
It's the same story of always.
They want to be famous, but that's what they do, they can't help it.
I'm a happy man and everything is fine.
Lawyers for Ronaldo are preparing a lawsuit against Der Spiegel for the allegations that appear in what they call "an unadmissible report on privacy suspicion", according to Reuters.
The lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player would be seeking damages for "moral damage for a sum that would be appropriate for the serious breach of his personal rights in the last few years.
According to reports, the incident took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga were supposed to have had sex in Ronaldo's room and there, according to the court records, Ronaldo allegedly raped anally the player, according to the court records.
Mayorga said Ronaldo kneeled after the incident and told him that he was 99 percent a good boy and that the one percent he had failed to fulfill was the "one percent" that was left.
The documents state that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that he was arrested by the police and took photos of the injuries in the hospital, but later agreed to a settlement outside of court because he feared "revenge" and "feared to be humiliated in public".
The woman, 34 years old, is trying to annul the agreement, as she is still traumatized by the events.
When the alleged assault took place, Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United and this summer he has changed to Juventus, a big Italian football club for a contract of 100 million €.
Brexit: The UK would regret always losing car manufacturers.
The UK would regret it for life if it lost its position as the world's leading carmaker after Brexit, said Secretary of Industry Greg Clark.
It was "unsettling" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that, if Britain left the EU without a deal, production at its Burnaston factory would be temporarily suspended.
We need a deal.
The Japanese manufacturer said that the impact of delays in customs would be a loss of jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which makes models Auris and Avensis for Toyota, produced 150 000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
I think Britain will break away from the EU in March, and there will be production disruptions in our factory.
Other British car manufacturers have expressed fears in relation to the UK's departure from the EU without a deal, especially in relation to cross-border trade; among them, Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, said it would close its Mini plant in Oxford one month after Brexit.
The main concerns of the car manufacturers are with the potential problems that could arise in the assembly lines in the case of a no-deal Brexit.
The production line of Toyota is based on the just in time (just in time) production method, where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the EU to build cars on order.
If the 29th of March the United Kingdom leaves the European Union without a deal, there could be a border interruption which, according to the sector, could cause delays and shortages of parts.
To Toyota it would be impossible to accommodate the equivalent of more than a day's inventory in its Derbyshire plant, said the company and, in such a case, production would be halted.
Mr. Clark said that the Chequers plan, where Theresa May's future relations with the EU are set, is "calibrated precisely to avoid those border controls at border crossings".
We need a deal. We want the best deal we can, so we can't just get out of this one.
"Evidence from Toyota, among others, is that we must be able to continue with the success of our current supply chain".
Toyota has not been able to say for how long production would stop, but warned that, over time, the additional costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and ultimately its profitability.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the Unite shop steward at the plant, said his members were becoming increasingly concerned: "As jobs are lost, they never recover".
A government spokesman said: "We have put in place a clear and convincing plan for our future relations with the EU".
The meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could be delayed, according to the White House
The meeting of high risk meeting between President Trump and the United States Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be delayed another week, as the dispute over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues.
Rosenstein supervises the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the Russian elections, potential ties between Trump's aid and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The anticipation of whether Trump would fire the attorney general or not and, in that case, compromise Mueller's independence has been fueling gossip in Washington for months.
A few days ago, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had recorded the conversations he had with Trump with a microphone he had brought with him to try to remove him by amending the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied that it was true.
However, on Monday, he went to the White House, with reports that he was about to resign.
In its place, a meeting with Trump was announced, which was to be held on Thursday.
Trump said he "would rather not" dismiss Rosenstein but the meeting had to be postponed to avoid a conflict with the Committee on the Judiciary of the United States Senate, in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump requested the FBI investigate for a week, which would delay the vote on the full Senate floor.
The White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, he said: "We have not yet decided on a date, and could be this week or it could be delayed, considering the Supreme Court's current situation.
We'll be deciding on the spot and I'll be keeping you updated as I do with the press.
Some journalists would refute that assertion: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10.
The host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of press conferences was not due to a dislike of TV journalists who act with grandiloquence, but said: "I don't disagree with the fact that they fanfarroned".
Then she suggested that direct contact between Trump and the media would increase.
"The president holds more question and answer sessions than any other president before him", said, while citing no evidence: "We have compared those numbers".
Press conferences will continue, said Sanders, but if the press has the option to ask directly the president of the United States, I think it is much better than asking me.
We tried to do it many times and you have seen us do it many times in the last few weeks, so that this would replace a press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States.
Trump usually answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in public or press conferences with dignitaries who visit.
The press conferences with him are held only very rarely.
This week, in New York, the president demonstrated why it was so, where he made an unexpected and, in some cases, bizarre, appearance to the journalists gathered there.
The Secretary of State for Health writes to NHS Scotland staff about their fears of a post-Brexit Brexit.
The Secretary of State for Health has written to the staff working in the HHS Scotland to express gratitude for their service and wish them well after the UK leaves the EU.
Jane Freeman MP sent a letter six months before the UK left the EU.
Scottish government has already committed to covering the cost of citizenship applications for EU citizens working in public services that are not under the central government's control.
Mrs. Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on the withdrawal process have continued, and the expected decisions were taken this autumn.
However, the UK government has also intensified preparations for a possible scenario in which there would be no agreement.
I know that it must be very confusing for you.
I would like to reiterate that I appreciate the contribution of each of the staff, regardless of their nationality.
Professionals from across the EU and other countries contribute valuable expertise and skills that enhance and strengthen the health service, which benefits patients and communities to which we serve.
Scotland is, without a doubt, your home and we are delighted to have you back.
Christopher Abercrombie is being operated on after suffering a head injury.
Christion Abercrombie, a Tennessee State Tigers player was operated on after suffering a head injury in the last minutes of the game, when they were losing 31-27 to Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ.
Coach Rod Reed reported to the media that the injury occurred before halftime.
He came to the band and fell there.
The trainers and the medical staff administered oxygen to Abercrombie on the sideline before placing him in a stretcher and transporting him to a deeper examination.
A member of the Tennessee State staff said to Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left the operation at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "no details on the type of injury or the damage caused" and the Tennessee State is trying to determine when it happened.
Abercrombie, sophomore redshirt, is playing his first season with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He made five tackles on Saturday before the game, with which he added 18 in the whole season.
Strangers will be charged a higher transfer tax when they buy property in the UK.
To foreigners, a higher transfer tax will be levied when they buy a property in the UK and the extra money will be used to provide shelter for the homeless, according to the new plans of the Conservatives.
The change will neutralize the success of the Labour Party's campaign to attract younger voters.
The land tax increase will be imposed on those who are not paying taxes in the UK.
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year to help the homeless
The additional money that is raised by the increase in the land transmission tax on foreign buyers of property in the UK will be used to help homeless people.
The measure is understood as an attempt to neutralize the success that is enjoying Jeremy Corbyn with his promises to provide affordable housing for voters under 30 and to target the richer members of society.
Increasing the land transmission tax will be levied on those who do not pay UK taxes and that money will be used to encourage the government to combat the problem of street begging.
The recargo, which is included in the current transmission tax, also includes an increase in levels that was introduced two years ago on second-hand houses and the "let-to-buy" system, which could reach up to 3%.
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year from this change.
It is estimated that 13% of new build properties in London are bought by people who are not resident in the UK, which increases the prices and makes it difficult for first time home buyers to access affordable housing.
Many of the country's wealthiest areas have become ghost towns (especially in the capital) due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson claimed a reduction in the estate tax to help young people buy their first home.
Accused the big builders of maintaining very high prices on properties they bought without intention of giving them any use and urged the Mrs. May to eliminate the housing quota that applies to affordable housing to solve the "vergonzoso problema de la vivienda" in Britain.
The Member has announced a series of attractive reforms, including controls on rent and the end of evictions without a cause.
It also proposes to give local authorities more powers to build new houses.
Mrs May said last year I said I would devote my first premiership to restoring the British dream of improving the life of every new generation.
This includes solving the housing market, which is so devastated.
Great Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not right that foreigners can buy homes in Britain at a lower cost than the British working class.
The dream of owning a home has become too difficult for many people and the humiliation of sleeping on the street is still too real.
My primary objective is to lead Scotland.
The Sunderland manager says his "primary objective" is to become the coach of Scotland at some point.
The 42-year-old Scottish, who is currently the third-ranked club in the North East League, is eager to revitalise the club, which is now in third place in the league, three points behind the first.
He was transferred to the newly built Stadium of Light this summer after leading the St. Mirren back to the Premier League last season.
I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
But I only got a B cap.
But I grew up watching Scotland play Hampden with my father when I was a child and it is something I always wanted to return.
That opportunity only becomes a reality if I can successfully manage a club.
Among the predecessors of Ross as leader of Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic manager said he did not feel any fear when he changed the club's name to a more established one, after rejecting offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
Now my success is measured by whether I can bring this club back to the Premier League.
Because the club's structure and facilities correspond to those of the Premier League.
It is not easy to achieve, but only when I can return the club to where it belongs.
Ross has been a coach for just three years, having been assistant at Dumbarton and a period of 15 months as a coach in the Hearts' coaching staff.
After that, he helped the Alloa to recover from relegation to the third division and helped the St. Mirren to win the championship in the following season.
Ross has been more comfortable playing for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical than ever before.
Probably it was a real juncture.
I always believed that direction was the best thing for me, much more than playing.
It may sound strange, because he was good, he could make a lot of money with it and enjoyed some epic moments.
But playing can be very tough.
You have to face many things each week.
I still feel stress and pressure from that job, but I feel better in the direction.
I've always wanted to train and now I've finally achieved it, it's the time of my life when I feel the best of all times.

According to a survey, the perfect time for a pint is 5:30 p.m. on Saturday.
The heat wave of the summer has pushed profits in British pubs to the brink, but the pressure is now concentrated on the restaurant chains.
The pubs and bars saw their sales increase by 2.7% in July, while the restaurant profits dropped by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, of CGA, who compiled the figures, said: "The heat of these days and the fact that England is still in the World Cup still kept the pattern of June, in which pubs increased by 2.8% their profits, but restaurants have fallen even more.
The decline in retail sales in June was even worse in July.
The pubs and bars that served mainly alcoholic beverages had their strongest month, compared to the majority of restaurants, where profits were reduced.
Bars that primarily served food also suffered from the heat, but not as much as the restaurants.
It seems people just want to drink.
In bars and pubs managed sales rose by 6.6% during the month, while food sales fell by 3%.
Paul Newman, a hotel and leisure analyst at RSM said: "These results follow the trend we've seen since the end of April.
The time and impact of social or sporting events of very important scale are still the most important factors in the market for out-of-home activities.
It is not surprising that the restaurant groups are still struggling, although the 4.8% decline in sales from the year before will be particularly painful in view of the continuing pressure on costs.
The long and hot summer would have come at the worst possible time for the food service operators and the weather will tell if the mild temperatures we have had in August will provide relief.
Total sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, increased by 2.7% in July, reflecting the slower decline in new brands.
In Coffer Peach Tracker, which oversees the sales in the UK's bars, restaurants and pubs sector, data is collected and analysed from 47 operational groups, with a combined turnover of more than 9 billion pounds and is the benchmark for the market.
One in five children have secret accounts on social media without their parents' knowledge.
One in five children (some even 11 years old) have secret accounts on social media without their parents and teachers' knowledge, according to a survey.
The survey, conducted on 20,000 secondary school students, revealed an increase in the number of fake accounts on Instagram.
The news coverage has aggravated fears that such content might be published.
About 20% of students said they had a "main" account that they show to their parents.
One in five children (some even as young as 11) create accounts on social media that hide from parents.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed a rapid growth in fake accounts on Instagram, a site for sharing photos.
The news has aggravated fears of sexual content.
About 20% of students said they had a "main" account that they showed to their parents, while also having other accounts.
A mother who stumbled across the secret hideout of her 13-year-old daughter saw how a teenager encouraged others to rape her.
The research, conducted by the Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters" and Headmistresses" Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40% of 11- to 18-year-old children had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private accounts.
Mr. Buchanan, director of HMC, said: "It is alarming that so many teenagers feel compelled to create online spaces where their parents and teachers could not find them".
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" in the board of the Scottish Athletics Federation.
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to be a member of the board of the Scottish athletics federation as non-executive director.
Doyle is the most decorated athlete in Scotland and her president, Ian Beattie, described the change as a great opportunity for those who seek to benefit from her international experience in the past decade.
"Eilidh is recognized and respected in the whole of athletics in Scotland, the UK and the world, and we are certainly benefited by the presence of Eilidh in her board," said Beattie.
I love being the spokesperson for athletes and I hope to be able to help develop sport in Scotland.
The American, who won the 200 metres and the 400 metres in the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, has been a frequent guest on BBC television and is now a regular on the BBC's sports programme.
He suffered a stroke last month.
I could not walk.
According to doctors, only time would determine whether I would recover or how much I would recover.
It has been a tough one, but I have managed to recover completely, I had to learn to walk again, and I am now doing exercises to improve my agility.
Thank you for the messages and words of encouragement!
The breastfeeding announcement that compares mothers to cows divides opinion on the Internet.
A breastfeeding company has divided the public opinion by posting an ad where it compares breastfeeding mothers to cows.
To mark the launch of the world's first silent breast pump, the consumer technology company Elvie published a humorous music video with a song that is ironic in tone.
Four real women dance in a hay barn full of hay, with the lyrics: "Yes, I'm milking myself, but I don't have a tail" and "If you happened to notice, they're not my breasts, they're my nipples".
The choir is still singing: "Ordine, ordine, I'm milking them, ordine, ordine, I'm milking my women".
However, the announcement, which was published on the Facebook page of the company, has sparked a great deal of controversy.
With over 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received a range of reactions from people who have seen it, where many say it brings to light the horrors of the dairy industry.
A very unfortunate decision to announce milk as a product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant before giving birth to produce milk, with the exception that they are taken away from their babies right after they are born.
The Elvie breast pump is discreetly worn as a breast pump (Elvie/Mother).
Another person said: "Traumatic for the mother and the baby.
But, yes, why not use them to announce a breast milk extractor for mothers who do stay with their babies?
Another comment was: “How dare you make such a crazy announcement?”
However, others defended the announcement, including a woman who admitted that the song was “hilarious”.
I think it is a great idea.
If she were still breastfeeding, she would certainly have one.
Using the bomb, I felt like a cow.
The announcement is a little crazy, but I don't give it more thought.
It is a genius product, I said to a woman.
Another person was commenting: “It was a funny ad for breastfeeding mothers (in some cases at work or in public toilets), which makes them feel like cows.
In the ad, the milk industry is not praised or condemned.
At the end of the video, the women show that they have been dancing with the discreet bombs in their brassières.
The campaign is based on the perception that many women who use the pump to extract milk say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is silent, does not have cables or tubes, and is discreetly worn inside the breastfeeding suit, enabling women to move, hold onto their babies, and even walk outside with the breast pump in operation.
Ana Balarin, Mother & ECD, says: “The Elvie Pump is a product that deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By showing the parallel between cow and cowgirl, we were trying to draw attention to the use of breast milk pumps and their challenges, while also demonstrating the incredible feeling of freedom that comes with the new breast milk pump.
This is not the first time the Elvie bomb has been in the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two children walked the runway for the designer Marta Jakubowski while wearing the product.
About 300 illegal immigrants were discreetly sheltered in a border camp.
The number of illegal immigrants detained has experienced a dramatic increase, despite the monthly flow of illegal immigrants into the border area having remained at a level that is usually.
Traditionally, most of the sponsors, who were also illegal immigrants at the time, feared that the proposal to host a child might put their own stay in the country at risk.
This risk increased in June, when the federal government announced that potential sponsors and other family members of the child's would be required to submit their fingerprints and data would be shared with immigration authorities.
The week before, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration official, testified before Congress that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) had arrested hundreds of people who had requested to sponsor children.
The agency confirmed later that 70% of those arrested had no criminal records.
The number of sponsors or their relatives who are illegally in the country is around 80%, and a large part of them are illegal immigrants.
We are still pursuing these people,” said Albence.
In their efforts to process children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that require some of them to appear before the court in a maximum of one month from the time of their arrest, rather than 60 days, which was the previous rule, according to workers at children's homes.
Many of them will testify by video conferencing, rather than in person, to defend their legal status in immigration proceedings.
Those who are not fit for shelter will be deported as soon as possible.
According to workers at the shelters and the system reports that have recently appeared, as long as they are held under detention, there is a greater chance that they will suffer from anxiety or depression, which could lead to violent outbursts or attempts to escape.
According to advocates, these concerns increase as the facilities get larger, such as the Tornillo facility where it is more likely that, due to its size, the evidence of dissatisfaction in these children will be overlooked.
Additionally, the transfer to the camp without giving them enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to their friends could cause them to suffer from post-traumatic stress.
If Syria requests that the occupation forces of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately.
In a speech before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Affairs Minister Walid al-Moualem also asked Syrian refugees to return to their homes, despite the war in Syria being in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also the deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces were illegally in Syrian territory under the pretense of fighting terrorism and that the issue would be dealt with accordingly.
“They must withdraw immediately and without conditions.”
Moualem insisted that the “terrorism war in Syria is effectively over, with 360,000 people dying and millions of people being displaced since 2011.
He said that Damascus would continue to fight in this holy war until we have cleared all Syrian territories of terrorist groups and any foreign presence that is illegal.
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, primarily providing training and advising Arab and Kurdish forces in Syria that are opposed to the Assad government.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in this country devastated by war.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said that conditions were right for them to return and blamed “some countries in the West” for “irrational fears” that kept refugees from returning to the country.
We have requested international and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns.
They are politicizing the issue of humanitarianism.
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not help rebuild Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition is reached.
UN diplomats said a recent UN-Turkey agreement to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib has created an opportunity for political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a major assault on the Syrian and Russian forces in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem has made clear that the agreement had clear terms and has expressed the hope that the military action will be focused on Al-Qaeda and other jihadists, including the Front Nusra (linked to Al-Qaeda), which will be eradicated.
Staffan de Mistura, a UN special envoy, is expected to hold shortly the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to draft a new constitution for Syria and to prepare the way for elections.
Moualem established conditions for the participation of Syrian government in the committee, arguing that the work of the panel should be limited to “reviewing the articles of the current constitution” and warned against any interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to that logic, Trump would win re-election in 2020, even if, as many liberal observers expect, a scandal or a final end to his presidency will prematurely end his presidency.
This would be the most dramatic end to a presidency ever seen!
At the moment there is no sign of wear and tear.
Since 2014, the ratings reached a peak of 1.05 million for CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million for MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in its primetime slot, compared with 1.7 million viewers in the same time period four years ago, according to Nielsen, and “The Rachel Maddow Show” on MSNBC has surpassed cable news channels in the top-rated news slot with 3.5 million viewers for its main evening news programs.
“It’s a strange attraction that we still haven’t understood,” says Neal Baer, author-producer of “Designated Survivor”, a dramatic series on a secretary of state who becomes president after a terrorist attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran playwright and author of “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club”, has another theory.
Remember a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The taxi driver told me that he would vote for Trump.
Why? Why?
Because it made me laugh, was the reply Scovell received.
Chaos is always rising in the entertainment world.
It is obvious that everything else on television is not going to be the case, but the arguments that come out of Washington could determine the outcome of the case Roe v. Wade, the possibility for immigrant families to reunite or the health of the global economy.
Unplugging is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
However, the information exceeds the limits when you realize that you have been sitting in front of a panel of experts debating the use of “deep background” sources that Woodward used to write his book “Fear”, the leather-jacketed turtle of 15,000 dollars that Paul Manafort (“a pride of excess”, in words of The Washington Post) and the horrific descriptions of Stormy Daniels of the anatomy of Trump.
I have no intention of seeing Mario again in the same way.
“By offering something new each night, it is part of what makes the show appear a reality show,” says Brent Montgomery, executive producer of “Pawn Stars”, when he talks about the cast rotating daily on Trump and his daily feud with the NFL.
You can't miss an episode if you don't want to be left behind.
When I met him last week, the weather was a sunny 27-degree day in the North Shore of Kauai, but he was inside his house watching CNN and MSNBC at the same time.
He couldn't get away from the television, not with Brett Kavanaugh ready to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging in the balance.
I remember when in those days we did all those crazy things with programs and people said that this was the end of the West's civilization.

The money flowed into the midterm election of the House of Representatives.
It is not a surprise that money is pouring into the 17th district of Pennsylvania, as a result of the restructuring of a congressional district with two candidates seeking reelection for the same seat.
This Pittsburgh district, which has recently undergone a major redesign, has the Democratic representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in a special election earlier this year.
Lamb faces another challenger for reelection, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th Pennsylvania district, which overlaps in large part with the new 17th.
The maps were redrawn after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the old districts had been manipulated unconstitutionally in favor of the Republicans.
The race for the new 17 has sparked a campaign financing battle between the main funding arms of the parties, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and the National Republican Committee (NRC).
The name Lamb was very familiar in Pennsylvania after a close election in a special election held in March for the 18th Congressional District.
This seat had been held by a Republican for ten years and President Donald Trump won by 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a slight edge.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for its support of China, but later rescinded the decision.
The diplomats observed that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with a slight rejection by Washington.
Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and stayed in a hotel in Panama until the management team of the Trump Organization was evicted.
The State Department officials decided to return U.S. ambassadors to El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of recent decisions to recognize Taiwan.
But only El Salvador was punished, which had already received a grant of around 140 million U.S. dollars from the United States in 2017 to, among other things, control drug trafficking, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts to financial assistance and visa restrictions, would have been very painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and criminality rates.
As the internal meetings progressed, the U.S. and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar conference held the year before, which was viewed as a step forward in efforts to prevent emigration to the United States.
But in mid-September, high officials in the administration made it clear that their intention was to keep the conference going, which put an end to any consideration of sanctions for El Salvador.
The vice president Mike Pence is scheduled to speak at the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October and is seen as a sign of the importance that the administration has placed on the meeting.
The three American ambassadors returned to the United States peacefully, without new threats or punishments from Washington.
A spokesman for the White House denied commenting on the details of the debate described by the three American diplomats, including two ambassadors, who agreed to keep their discussions confidential.
His explanations were corroborated by an external analyst, who spoke anonymously.
The study of history.
The next step would be the report by special prosecutor Robert Mueller on possible obstruction of justice by Trump, of which there are compelling public records.
It is also believed that Mueller is investigating whether the campaign for Trump's presidency was working with Russia in parallel with the Russian interference in our election.
If the House changes hands, Trump will be answerable to that chamber, just as he is preparing to run for re-election, and perhaps finally before a jury of his peers.
This is a lot of conditionalities, and with it I don't suggest that the fall of Trump is inevitable, nor the equivalents in Europe.
We will have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will have an effect on the length of the war.
In 1938, German officers were ready to give a coup d'état against Hitler. Only a resistance from the West and support for Czechoslovakia in Munich would have been enough.
We failed and we lost the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The history of the world is about these turning points, and the march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
The Americans now face several of these turning points.
What will happen if Trump fires Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a good position since this newspaper reported that he had suggested secretly to record the president and had speculated that he was unfit for the office.
Rosenstein says the Times' explanation is wrong.
“How will we respond if the new F.B.I. request for Brett Kavanaugh’s new investigation is incomplete or unfair, or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony,”
In addition to all this, will we be voting in the midterm elections for a Congress that will be accountable to Trump?
If we fail these tests, we will find ourselves in a long winter for democracy.
But because I learned a lesson in Prague, I believe we won't fail.
My mother was a Czech Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had once occupied my house as an ambassador.
He survived, emigrated to the United States and, 60 years later, sent me to light the Sabbath candles on the same table with an SS symbol.
With that legacy, how could I not be optimistic about our future?

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers, optimistic about the match against Vienna.
The Rangers will play their home game on Thursday against Rapid Vienna knowing that a victory over the Austrians, after the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal at the beginning of this month, will place them in a strong position to qualify in the Group G of the UEFA Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season until the 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes that the result can be used as a springboard for bigger things.
We managed to get a good point, as Villarreal is a good team.
We started the game thinking we could do something and we ended up with a draw.
Maybe we could have won the war, but, in general, the draw was probably a fair result.
They were best in the first half, but after the break they came out to play and we were the best team.
This week we will have another great European night.
I hope we can achieve the three points, but I'm aware that they have already achieved a good result in the previous game. But, with our home crowd supporting us, I'm sure we can progress and obtain a positive result.
The year last year was a tough one for me with injuries and club changes, but now I feel a more positive attitude toward the season ahead.
The team is fine, the kids are enjoying themselves and are having a good training.
I have the hope that we can overcome the past season and achieve success.
The fear of retirement savings is making women sleep worried.
Although participants in the survey had a clear idea of how they wanted to be treated, they are few who discuss this with their families.
About half of those who participated in the study said they spoke with their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent of respondents said they spoke to their children about this issue.
People want to be cared for by a relative, but they are not talking about this conversation.
This is how to begin.
Talk to your spouse and children: you can't prepare your family to look after you if you don't express your wishes in advance.
Work with your advisor and your family to discuss where and how to receive care, as that can be a significant determinant of the cost.
Incorporate in the conversion to his or her financial advisor, as he or she can also help you find a way to pay for those expenses.
Options for long-term care can include a traditional insurance policy, a life insurance policy with cash value, or you can cover your own costs by saving money.
Purchase legal documents: be ahead of the legal battles.
Get a medical referral power to appoint a trusted person to oversee your medical care and ensure that healthcare providers and nurses comply with your wishes in case you cannot communicate.
You can also prepare a power of attorney for your finances.
Select a trusted person to act as a trustee for you and ensure that your financial affairs are handled if you become disabled.
Don't forget the small details: imagine that your elderly father has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer the questions on drugs and allergies?
Specify these details in a written plan so that you always have them ready.

They shot him with a rifle in Ilfracombe.
They have shot a man with a rifle while he was walking home after dark.
The victim, a man of around 40 years, was in the area of Oxford Grove in Ilfracombe (Devon) when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Officers described the shooting, which occurred around 02:30 (British time), as an “accidental” act.
The victim did not see the assailant.
His injuries are not life-threatening and the police have made a plea for witnesses.
Tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the city of Palu on Friday, and it is expected that the number of deaths will increase.
With communications blocked, officials of assistance have been unable to obtain any information from the regency of Donggala, an area to the north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important details about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, which is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a regency that stretches along more than 300 kilometers (180 miles) of coastline in the northwestern part of Sulawesi Island.
The regency, which is a lower-level administrative unit, had a population of 299,200 people in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of Central Sulawesi, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining also has its importance in the province, but is concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite side of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been affected by earthquakes several times in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck the west of Donggala in 1996, with nine deaths.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire, a region with a high earthquake activity, and earthquakes are common.
Then we summarize some of the most important earthquakes and earthquakes of the last few years:
2004: A major earthquake in the western coast of Aceh province in North Sumatra, Indonesia, on 26 December 2004, caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries and killed 226,000 people in the coast of the Indian Ocean.
A series of powerful earthquakes struck the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
There were hundreds of deaths on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
A major earthquake of magnitude 6.8 struck the south of Java, the island with the largest population in Indonesia, and caused a tsunami that killed almost 700 people.
2009: A major earthquake of magnitude 7.6 struck near the city of Padang, the capital of the West Sumatra Province.
1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck the Mentawai Islands, near Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 metres that destroyed hundreds of villages and killed 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the regency of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing destruction and panic to remember the devastation of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but the collapse of buildings caused the death of more than 100 people.
2018: The tourist island of Lombok (Indonesia) had a series of earthquakes of great magnitude that caused the death of more than 500 people, most of them in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and tens of thousands of tourists were left homeless.
The eldest daughter of Sarah Palin was arrested for domestic violence charges.
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and former vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested for assault.
Palin, 29, and a resident of Wasilla (Alaska), was arrested under suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a report of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to the published report by the state police on Saturday.
According to the police report, when a known person tried to call the police to report a crime, he took her phone away.
A Palin was detained in Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is held with a $500 bail bond, which is not guaranteed.
He was presented before the court, where he was acquitted when he was asked to give his statement, reported the news.
Palin is charged with three minor offenses, which carries a maximum sentence of one year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a minor Class B offense, with a one-day jail sentence and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report a purported attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska veterans court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, of interfering with a complaint of domestic violence and of possessing a firearm in a drunken state, in relation to the incident.
His girlfriend said that she had been punched in the face.
A number of veterans groups criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 for linking the violent behavior of her son to the posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) suffered from his service in Iraq.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after a major earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake of a magnitude of 7.5 caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have fallen and it is expected that the number of deaths will increase over the next days.
The earthquake occurred just a few miles from the center of Sulawesi, which is located in the northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
There are several videos that circulate on social media and show the impact.
Centenars of people had gathered for a beach party in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
The federal prosecutors seek exceptionally harsh punishment for suspected terrorist attacks in New York.
The federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the terrorist attack on New York City that killed eight people, a rare federal sentence that has not been carried out in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years of age, used a rental car from Home Depot to carry out a bicycle attack on the West Side of Manhattan's FDR Drive in October, killing pedestrians and cyclists who were in its way.
To justify the death penalty, the prosecution must prove that Saipov killed "intentionally" eight people and caused "intentionally" serious bodily injury, according to the District Attorney's intention to request the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
The two charges carry a possible death sentence, according to the court document.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury filed a 22-count indictment against Saipov, including eight counts of murder with the aid of organized crime, which is the standard federal charge for these cases, and a charge of destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “substantial planning and premeditated planning”, according to the prosecution, which described the manner in which Saipov carried out the attack as “atrocious, cruel and depraved”.
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco”, is stated in the notice of intent.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
It has been ten years since the last time the South Bronx District Court tried a death sentence.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was ultimately sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a federal death penalty was carried out in New York was for the Rosenbergs, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union in 1953.
The two Rosenbergs were executed by electrocution on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, an immigrant from Uzbekistan, showed no remorse after the attack, according to court documents.
According to the police, he told investigators he was feeling fine about what he had done.
The accused told authorities that he had said to police that he was inspired by watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also requested that the flag of ISIS be flown in his room at the hospital.
He was acquitted of the 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the public defender attorneys who represented Saipov, said they were “very disappointed” with the decision of the prosecution.
We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept a guilty plea with a mandatory sentence of life without possibility of parole will only prolong the trauma of these events for all those involved.
The defense team had previously requested that the death penalty be denied.
Member of Parliament Tory says Farage should be in charge of Brexit talks
Farage promised to mobilize the people's army today at a Tory conference.
The UKIP leader said that politicians had to feel the heat of the euro-sceptics, while one of the MPs for Theresa May suggested that he should be in charge of the talks with the EU.
MP Peter Bone said in Birmingham that the Conservative Party would have already left the EU if Farage had been Foreign Secretary.
But the challenge facing the First Minister Theresa May to reconcile her divided ranks has been highlighted when a group of Conservative supporters of remaining in the European Union have joined a protest against the Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is fighting to keep the Chequers Compromise plan afloat in the face of attacks from the Leave campaigners, her opponents and the EU.
The allies insisted on reaching a deal with Brussels, despite the violent reaction, and will force the Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between their package and chaos.
The MP Bone said in the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to reject the Chequers plan.
He suggested that Mr Farage should have been given a role in the talks with Brussels.
If he had been in charge, we would have already left.
This Member of Parliament for Wellingborough said: “I will defend the Brexit, but we must get rid of Chequers.”
In his opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought wars to be subservient.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Bone rejected suggestions that the public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British public has changed its mind and wants to stay in the European Union is completely false.”
The Tory pro-Brexit Andrea Jenkyns also attended the rally, where she said to the media: “Only one thing: First Minister, listen to the people.”
The public at large does not like the Chequers plan, the opposition is not going to vote for it and it is not popular with our activists, who are the ones who actually get out and vote for us first.
Forget about Chequers and start listening.
In a message to Mrs. May, he said: Mayors keep their jobs when they make their promises.
Farage said to the crowd that it would be necessary to “make the heat” to politicians if they were to be seen to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
Now it is a question of trust between us, the people, and our political class.
They are trying to betray Brexit and today we are here to say we will not let them get away with it.
In a message to the jubilant crowd, he said: “Let our political class, who are about to betray Brexit, feel the heat.”
We will mobilize the people’s army of this country that gave us the victory with Brexit and never rest until we have become an independent, autonomous and proudly independent country.
While the supporters of staying stayed in the streets of Birmingham before the two-hour rally in the city center.
Some activists were holding banners of Tories Against Brexit after the group's presentation this weekend.
The Labour Lord Adonis mocked the Tories for their security problems with a party application during the opening of the conference.
These are the same people who say they can implement computer systems and all the technology for Canada Plus Plus, for border harmony, for free trade in Ireland, and for free trade without borders in Ireland.
It is a total farce.
There is no good Brexit, and there is no such thing as a good exit.
Warren considers all possibilities for the presidency.
Senator Warren says she will consider all options for running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that Democratic candidate Martha Coakley spoke about her future during a municipal meeting in the western part of the state.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for reelection in November against Geoff Diehl, the state representative who was co-chair of Trump's campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
There has been considerable speculation that Warren will challenge Trump in 2020.
The event in Holyoke was his thirty-sixth meeting with voters using the municipal format since he took office.
A question was asked as to whether he was considering running for president.
Warren said that it is time for women to go to Washington to fix our irregular government, and that includes having a woman in the highest office.
A sus 21 años, el jugador de fútbol americano de la Universidad de Luisiana, Sims, fue asesinado a tiros en un club nocturno de Nueva Orleans.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced this Saturday that a suspect has been arrested for the murder of Wayde Sims, a basketball player from LSU, on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department arrested Dyteon Simpson, 20, in a news conference at 11 a.m.
They had published a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help in identifying the man in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot dead at the university campus at around 5:30 am on Friday.
“Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head that eventually led to his death”, said Chief of Police Murphy J. Paul to the media on Saturday, 247sports.
Wayde went to defend a friend and was shot by Simpson.
During the interrogation, Simpson admitted to being at the scene of the crime, in possession of a weapon and having fired at Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and was detained in the East Baton Rouge Parish police department.
Simms, a native of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, played in 32 games last season, starting in 10 of them, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Grand Prix of Russia: Hamilton is closing in on the World Championship title after his team's orders handed him the win over Sebastian Vettel
As soon as Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton, it was clear that Mercedes' orders would be important in the race.
From pole position, Bottas had a good start and almost forgotten Hamilton by defending his position in the first two laps and inviting his teammate to attack him.
Vettel was the first to enter the pits and let Hamilton lead the group, which should have been decisive.
The Mercedes came out with a forceful turn later and got behind Vettel, but Hamilton overtook him after a near-close action with the wheels almost touching that made the Ferrari driver reluctant to give up the free space to defend after a double movement to defend himself in the third turn.
Max Verstappen, who was 21 years old on that day, started from the last row of the grid and ended up in seventh place at the end of the first lap.
He led the first half of the race while holding onto his tyres to achieve a quick exit and overtake Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
Finally, he made his way into the pits at the end of the 44th lap, but could not increase his pace in the last eight laps to reclaim fourth place.
It has been a tough day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and was a real gentleman by letting me through.
The team has done an excellent job in finding a perfect partner.
That was a bad body language.
The president Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein for her insistence that she did not leak the Christine Blasey Ford letter in which she accused Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
In a rally in West Virginia, the president did not mention the testimony offered by Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but he did say that what was going on in the Senate showed that there was “bad, repugnant and false people”.
“Only one thing could happen and it is good that is happening these last days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people who are bad, repugnant and false.
When you read the publications and leaked information, and then you say “But I did not do it.
I didn't do it.
Do you remember?
Did you filter it?
Remember your answer... Did you filter the document? - “Oh, no, no, ¿qué?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak it.
Wait a minute.
We have leaked it, we haven't leaked it.
A Feinstein sent the letter in which details of the allegations against Kavanaugh by Ford in July and was leaked to the press in September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his office.
“I did not hide the allegations of the Dr. Ford, I did not leak her story,” said Feinstein to the committee, as reported by The Hill.
She asked me to keep it confidential and so I did.
But their refusal did not seem to sit well with the president, who during the rally of the evening of Saturday said the following: “I will tell you one thing: that has been a bad body language.
I don't know, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen.
Continuing to defend the nominee for the Supreme Court, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that Democrats were using the allegations against them for their own ends.
They are determined to regain power by any means necessary.
You see evil and repugnance, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to crush to get power and control.
The Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against the Dundee.
The Dundee Stars reversed the defeat on Saturday in the Elite League by beating the Belfast Giants 5-3 on Sunday in Dundee.
The Giants took an early lead with goals from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied for the lead before Dwyer restored the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee before Lundvald Nielsen scored two goals to secure his team's victory.
This has been the third defeat of the season for the men of Adam Keefe, who had previously beaten Dundee 2-1 in Belfast last night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, of which the Giants had won the three previous games.
The first goal of Dwyer came in the fourth minute (3:35) with an assist from Kendall McFaull, while David Rutherford provided the assist for Beauvillier to double the lead four minutes later.
In the early phase of the game, Sullivan revived the local team's enthusiasm by having them play in the 13:10 minute before Marquardt assisted Cownie for the equalizer in the 15:16 minute.
Dwyer secured a lead before halftime when he scored his second goal in the first half.
The home team re-grouped and Bouchard once again equalized the game with a goal in the 27th minute.
Cownie and Corcoran combined to help Dundee lead for the first time in the game at halftime and secure the victory with the fifth goal of their team as the game neared the end.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, play host to Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
A controller dies so that hundreds of people can escape on an airplane from the earthquake.
An Indonesian air traffic controller is hailed as a hero after dying in an attempt to save a plane carrying hundreds of people.
Over 800 people died and many were missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi, causing a tsunami.
The strong shaking continues to plague the area and many are trapped in the rubble in Palu.
Despite his fellow passengers fleeing for their lives, Anthonius Gunawan Agung, 21, refused to leave his post at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
He was firm in ensuring that the flight 6321 of Batik Air, which was on the runway at the time, could safely take off.
After the tower controller jumped off the control tower when he thought the building was about to collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
The Indonesian Air Navigation Authority's spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, reported ABC News.
We had prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died today before the helicopter reached Palu.
Our hearts break when we hear this.
While the number of deaths is feared to be several thousand, the national disaster management agency says that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“It is believed that the number of deaths will continue to increase, as there were still many bodies under the rubble and it has been difficult to reach out to a lot of people,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves that reached six metres have devastated Palu, which will hold a mass graveyard Sunday.
The aid and supplies are being flown in by military and commercial aircraft.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said to Sky News: “Each minute comes a paramedic with more bodies.
Water is scarce.
Mini-markets are being looted everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: “The Red Cross is trying to help as much as possible survivors, but we don’t know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but could have been much worse.
The Indonesian president, Joko Widodo, arrived in Palu on Sunday and said to the army: “We ask you all to work day and night to complete all evacuation tasks.
Are they ready?”, reported CNN.
Indonesia had already been struck by earthquakes in Lombok in which more than 550 people died.
Air Niugini now says a man has disappeared after the crash of a plane in a lake.
The airline, which operates a flight that crashed in a lake in the Pacific Ocean, now says that a man has disappeared after it had said that the 47 passengers and crew had evacuated the plane safely.
Air Niugini said in a statement that a male passenger was not found on board the flight.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to try to find the man.
The airline did not respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Ships from the local fishermen were used to help rescue the other passengers and the crew after the plane crashed into the sea while attempting to land on the island of Chuuk.
The authorities said on Friday that seven people had been transferred to a hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in hospital and all were in good health.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events are still unclear.
The airline and the United States Navy said the plane landed in the lake that is before the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had landed.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed very low.
That is a good thing to say.
Jaynes said that he and other travellers managed to make it through the water that was up to their waists until the emergency exits of the plane they were on began to sink.
He said that flight attendants were frightened and screamed, and that he suffered a mild head injury.
The United States Navy said that its sailors who were working on a nearby pier also helped in the rescue by using a floating inflatable boat to carry people ashore before the plane sank some 30 meters (100 feet) underwater.
The data in the airline safety network indicates that 111 people have died in airline accidents in Papua New Guinea in the last two decades, but none with Air Niugini.
A chronology of the night when a woman was burned alive.
The prosecution concluded its arguments on Saturday in the new trial of a man accused of murdering a woman in Mississippi in 2014.
The analyst from the United States Department of Justice, Paul Rowlett, testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He testified to the way he used mobile phone records to tie the movements of Quinton Tellis, the 29-year-old accused, and Jessica Chambers, the 19-year-old victim, the night she died.
Rowlett said that he received the location data of several mobile phones showing that Tellis was with Chambers the night he died, contradicting his earlier statements, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his mobile phone had been with Chambers during the time he said he was with Sanford, the police went to speak with Sanford.
Sanford rose to the podium on Saturday and testified that he had not been in the city that day.
When the prosecution asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in the car with Sanford that night, Sanford said he was lying, because his car was in Nashville.
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he had met Chambers approximately two weeks before his death.
The mobile records indicated that they met only a week before.
Rowlett said that after Chambers' death, Tellis erased the messages, calls and contact information from Chambers' phone.
“He erased her from his life”, said Hale.
The defense is scheduled to present its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he hoped the trial would be completed that day.
What is hip hop consciousness?
A hip-hop trio wants to fill their music with positive messages to challenge the negative image of hip-hop.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims hip hop has drifted from its original messages of political and social themes.
They want to return to their roots and make hip hop consciousness popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have seen a recent revival in the UK thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
A New York nanny sued a couple for firing her after she wrote a racist text.
A New York nanny sued a couple for wrongful dismissal after receiving a text message from the mother complaining that she was “a black person”.
The couple denies that they are racist and compare the case to a case of extortion.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, expressed her shock at discovering that the new childcare provider, Giselle Maurice, was black on her first day of work in 2016.
“NOOOOOOOOOOO OTRO NEGRO”, wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending it to his husband, she sent it to Maurice twice.
After realizing his mistake, Plasco-Flaxman fired Maurice, saying that his former nanny, an African American, had been a poor worker and that he would now hire a Filipina nanny instead.
Mr. Maurice received his pay for a day's work and sent it home in a Uber.
Mr. Maurice is now suing the couple for compensation for the dismissal with intent to receive a  compensation of 350 dollars a day for six months of work as an intern, although without a contract.
I want to show them that things are not done that way.
The couple responded to allegations that they were racists by saying that the termination of Maurice's employment was the most reasonable, as they feared she would not be trusted after she had offended them.
My wife sent him something she didn't want to say.
She is not racist.
We are not racists, said husband Joel Plasco.
But would you leave your children in the hands of someone who has been rude to you, even though it was an accident?
Do you have a newborn?
“Come on!”
Comparing the demand as an “extortion”, Plasco said his wife had given birth two months earlier and was in a “very difficult” situation.
Do you want to go with that kind of person?
It is not a very decent thing to say.
Although the legal case is still ongoing, the public opinion has already begun to condemn the couple in the social media, criticizing their behaviour and their logic.
The Paddington Bear editors feared that readers would not identify with a talking bear, and so they sent a letter to the editor.
Karen Jankel, daughter of Bond, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said: “It was difficult to put yourself in the place of someone reading the book for the first time before publication.
It's funny to know now what we know about the great success of Paddington.
After saying that his father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before he wrote the book for children, trusted that his work would be rejected, he added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was something “agridulce” after his death last year.
She described her father as “a very important member of our family”, and said that he was very proud of his son's success.
He was a quiet man and he did not like to be the center of attention.
But as Paddington had been so real to him, it was almost as if you had a child who achieved something important: you are proud of him, even though it was not really his own achievement.
I think he saw success in Paddington that way.
Although he created it and it was his own creation, he always gave credit to himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to hang up the phone.
On landing, her daughter was immediately transferred to the Louis Pasteur Hospital 2 in Nice, where doctors worked tirelessly to save her life.
“Nad called regularly to say that the situation was really bad, that he did not expect to succeed.”
After receiving Nad's call, I received a call from Nad to say that she was going to die in two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
So I did it.
I said to him: “Tashi, I love you, dear.
I will be with you soon.
I will be with you.
The drugs that doctors had given him to keep his heart beating slowly and his system waning left him.
She had died before time and everything was fading.
I could only sit there and wait, knowing that all this was going on.
I could not howl, scream, or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to stand up to him.
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now suffering for the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, unaware of the terrible experience she was about to endure.
“No one knew it”, said.
I fell to my knees and my tears fell down on me.
It is difficult to explain, but it was on the plane that I felt this overwhelming sense of sympathy for Nad.
I needed all my love and understanding.
He knew how much he loved her.
Women in mourning place a bridge to prevent suicides.
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide are working to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been putting cards on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and numbers for people to call for help.
Tyler, the son of Mrs. Davis, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any father to feel what I feel every day.”
Davis, 45 years old and living in Lydney, said her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
All knew him by his smile.
They always said that their smiles brightened any place.
However, he left work before he died, as he was in a place that was “really dark”.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, found him after he had taken his own life.
Mrs. Davis said: “I am constantly concerned that it might have negative repercussions.”
Davis created the cards so that people know that there are people to whom you can call and who can talk to, even if they are a friend.
Don't be silent, you have to speak it.
Mrs. Humphreys, who is Davies's friend since years, lost her partner Mark, his partner with whom she had been living for 15 years, shortly after the death of his mother.
He didn't say he was depressed, but he said he wasn't feeling good.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed his change of attitude.
Christmas Day was the lowest point: when children opened their gifts, he did not even look at them.
He said that his death was a great trauma for them, but that they must overcome it: “He left a void in the whole family.”
He has left us broken.
But we all have to continue to fight.

The future of Brett Kavanaugh hangs in the balance as the FBI begins its investigation.
“I thought we could get something like what I was asking (a limited-time, scope-limited investigation), perhaps we could bring a little bit of unity,” said Senator Flake on Saturday, saying he feared the committee was “sinking into a partisan stalemate.”
Why Kavanaugh and his Republican allies did not want the FBI investigation to be carried out?
His refusal is entirely due to the chronology.
There are only five weeks until the midterm elections, on November 6. If Republicans have a bad election, their efforts to elect the man they want for the Supreme Court will be seriously weakened.
George W. Bush has been calling on senators, pressuring them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for him in the White House. Thanks to Bush, Kavanaugh met his wife Ashley, who was the personal secretary to the President.
What happens when the FBI publishes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie and confirm him for the Supreme Court.
Number of defectors from North Korea “fall” with Kim.
The number of defectors from North Korea to South Korea has been declining since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago, a South Korean legislator said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Ministry of Unification of the South, said there were 1,127 desertions in 2012 compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Park said that tighter border controls between North Korea and China, and high fees charged by human traffickers have been the key factors.
Pyongyang has not made public statement on the matter.
Most deserters from the north are offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans crossed the border illegally from the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the DMZ.
China sees illegal immigrants as illegal aliens and often repatriates them.
The relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have improved considerably in the last months.
At the beginning of the month, leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to have talks that focused on the nuclear disarmament talks.
This occurred after the historic meeting in June between the president of the United States Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Singapore, which agreed in general to work for a peaceful, nuclear-free Korea.
But on Saturday, the Foreign Minister of North Korea, Ri Yong-ho, blamed the United States' sanctions for the lack of progress.
“With the trust of the U.S., we will not have any confidence in our national security and, under these circumstances, of no means will we be the first to disarm unilaterally,” said Ri in a speech before the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls him “crazy” and says he is not fit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Nancy Pelosi, the Minority Leader of the House, said that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was a “histrician” and that he was not fit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin.
“I can’t stop thinking that if a woman had acted in that way, they would have said she was a histrion.
Kavanaugh served up emotion to deny the allegations that he had sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
During his initial statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, screaming and choking while speaking of his family and his years of secondary schooling.
In the committee, it also condemned explicitly the Democrats, accusing them of “grotesque and clearly coordinated defamation” by a liberal angered by Hillary Clinton’s loss of the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that, in her opinion, Kavanaugh's testimony showed that he would not be a good Supreme Court justice because he showed partisan bias against Democrats.
I think he has himself disqualified himself by making those statements and the way he has pursued the Clinton and the Democrats.
Pelosi put her objections when she was asked if she would challenge Kavanaugh in the case he was confirmed in the Senate and if the Democrats obtained a majority in the House.
“Only one thing: if he is lying to Congress or the FBI, he is not fit to be on the Supreme Court, and he will not even be fit to be on the court in which he is now sitting.”
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about possible Kavanaugh's possible sentences against the Affordable Care Act or the Case Roe v. Wade, which she considered to be a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overturn Supreme Court decisions.
This is not the time for a non-partisan, impartial person to go to court and expect us to think everything is fine.
And women have to hold it.
It is a rage that is justified, months and years of rage unleashed, and she cannot stop crying.
“We cry when we angry,” said Ms. Steinem 45 years later.
I don't think it's anything unusual, do you?
He was helped by a woman who was an executive in some company and she told me that she too was angry when she was angry, but that she had developed a technique by which when she was angry and began to cry, she would say to the person with whom she was speaking: “Maybe you think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry.
And then I was doing what I was doing.
I thought it was great.
Tears are allowed as a way to release anger because they are generally not understood.
One of the clearest memories I have from my first job was when I was crying with a rage that I had never had before. A mature woman, a manager who always seemed to have a slight fear of me, grabbed me by the nape of my neck and dragged me up the stairs.
Don't let them ever see you cry.
They don't know that you're angry.
They believe you are sad because they think you have been cornered.
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a Democratic Congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Hart was caught up in an extramarital affair aboard a ship called Monkey Business by which he had to withdraw from the presidential race, Schroeder, deeply frustrated, came up with the idea of herself running for the presidency.
It wasn't premeditated, but it was a good decision.
There were seven candidates in the race and what they needed was a woman.
Someone referred to us as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
The campaign was already well advanced, so it was left behind in fundraising, so it was promised that it would not enter the race unless it raised two million dollars.
It was a lost battle.
He discovered that some of his supporters who gave $1,000 to the men, she only received $250.
“Do you think I have a discount?” asked.
When she delivered her speech announcing that she would not be running a formal campaign, she was overwhelmed by the emotions (gratitude for the people who had supported her, frustration with a system that made it difficult to raise funds and to get delegates, and rage at sexism).
“It would have been logical to have thought that he had a nervous breakdown.” said Schroeder.
You could have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I thought, what will be on my tombstone?
“Do you cry?”
The trade war between the United States and China could benefit Beijing.
The first round of trade war between the United States and China were loud and unmistakable, and although the battle is still ongoing, a break between the countries could benefit Beijing, according to experts.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, issued the first warning in early 2017 when he imposed tariffs on the main exports from China, such as solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant new tax hike this week was a 200,000-million-dollar (150,000-million-pound) levy on imports, which charges half of the imports that enter the United States from China.
Beijing has taken retaliatory measures, applying a five to ten percent duty on American products for a value of $60 billion.
China has pledged to match the attacks of the United States, and it is unlikely that the second largest economy in the world will soon give up.
To make Washington backtrack would mean yielding to the demands, but publicly submitting to the United States would be too shameful for the Chinese president Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards right, the trade war could help positively benefit China by reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a quick decision in Washington or Beijing can lead to a plunge in the economy in either country is much more dangerous than the audience has realized so far,” said Abigail Grace, a senior fellow at the Center for New American Security.
If Syria is ready to accept refugees, then so is the United States.
Syria claims to be ready to accept refugees and requests help to rebuild a country that has been devastated by a war that has lasted more than seven years.
In a speech before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the country was improving.
The situation on the ground is now more stable and secure than it was before the progress made in the fight against terrorism.
The government is still rehabilitating areas destroyed by terrorists to try to restore normalcy.
There are all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees who had to flee the country due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their lives daily and their means of livelihood.
The UN estimates that, since the beginning of the war in 2011, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country.
There are still six million people living in the country and they need humanitarian assistance.
Moualem acknowledged that Syria would be grateful for assistance in rebuilding the country.
But he also emphasized that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that supported the insurgency.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris.
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the American team with a score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National, outside Paris (France).
The United States has now suffered six consecutive defeats in Europe since the last time it won the Ryder Cup in Europe in 1993.
Europe regained the crown when the Danish team captain Thomas Bjorn's team scored 14.5 points to beat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had to fight for much of the tournament, threw his ball into the water at the par-3 16th hole, admitting his defeat to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari excelled in all his rounds, becoming one of four players to ever achieve a 5-0-0 in the current format of the tournament.
The American Jordan Spieth fell to the lowest-ranked player in the European team, Danish Thorbjorn Olesen.
World number one Dustin Johnson fell 2 and 1 to Englishman Ian Poulter, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
Spanish golfer Sergio García, who has already won eight Ryder Cups, is the European with the most victories in the history of the tournament, with 25.5 points in his career.
I don't cry, but I can't help it.
It has been a tough year.
I am grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I am very, very happy to have been able to recover the cup.
It is a team achievement and I am delighted to have been able to help.
Now the torch is passed to his compatriot John Rahm, who already beat the legendary American golfer Tiger Woods in a singles match.
I feel a tremendous pride to have beaten Tiger Woods, as I grew up watching him.
Woods lost four matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in his career of the Ryder Cup.
This is a strange statistic for one of the best players of all time, who has won 14 major titles, placing him behind only Jack Nicklaus.
The American team had to fight hard to find the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a superb golf throughout the tournament.
Captain Jim Furyk spoke after the disappointing performance of his team: “I’m very proud of these guys, they’ve never given up.
There was a time this morning when we were heating up the situation in Europe.
But we ruined it.
I want to congratulate Thomas.
He is a great captain.
Their 12 players have played a very good game.
We will re-unite, I will meet with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee, and we will continue on.
I love these 12 boys and I am proud to be their captain.
Now it is our turn to bow our heads.
They have overtaken us.
Red tide update: Disminutions in concentrations in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota counties
The new report of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission (Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission) shows a reduction in the concentrations of red tide in areas of the Bay of Tampa.
According to the FWC, there are irregular bloom conditions in the counties of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, which suggests a decline in concentrations.
The bloom of the red tide extends approximately 130 miles of coastline from the county of Pinellas in the north to the county of Lee in the south.
There are irregular plots of land at about 10 miles from the coast of Hillsborough County, but there are fewer sites compared to the week before.
The red tide has also been observed in the county of Pasco.
During the last week, the average concentration in the Pinellas County and its coast, the average concentration in the Hillsborough County coast, the average concentration in the Manatee County coast, the average concentration in the Sarasota County coast, the average concentration in the Charlotte County coast, the average concentration in the Lee County coast, and the average concentration in the Collier County coast were all between low and moderate.
There are still reports of respiratory irritation in the counties of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
No respiratory problems were reported in the northwestern part of Florida during the last week.
