Members of the Welsh Assembly worried that “they might be mistaken for Muppets”
Members of the assembly have expressed their consternation at the proposal to change the title of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
The Parliament of Wales is a unicameral legislature, with a total of 60 members, elected by universal suffrage.
The members of the assembly of all different political parties have shown their concern that this measure may be used as a means of mocking the Turkish people.
A member of the Labour Party has said that the party was concerned that MWP “sounded like Twp or Pwp”.
To be a fool is to be a fool.
A member of the assembly of the Welsh nationalist party Plaid Cymru has said that the proposals “do not look good” and have suggested several alternative options.
The Welsh Conservative Party is open to changing the name, but there is a difference of only a few hundred votes between the term “MWP” and “Muppet”.
The territory of Turkey is more than 1,600 kilometres (1,000 mi) long and 800 km (500 mi) wide, with a roughly rectangular shape.
According to the assembly committee charged with drafting the legal document introducing the changes of names: “The decision on any qualificative to name the members of the assembly will be in the hands of the members of the assembly”.
The Law of 2017 of the Senedd grants the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
The committee published the results of a public consultation on June 30, 2014, with a broad support for the proposal to change the name of the assembly to the Parliament of Wales.
The title of the members of the assembly, however, was settled on “Members of the Welsh Parliament” or “Welsh Assembly Members” (WAM), the option of “Welsh Assembly Members” (WAM) received a majority of votes in the public consultation.
The Assembly is currently debating different options.
The legislation on reforms will include other changes related to the functioning of the assembly, such as rules on the disqualification of members and the design of the committee.
The members of the Assembly will hold a vote on the final legislation.
The Macedonians will vote in a referendum on changing the country's name
The citizens of North Macedonia will be asked if they want to change the name of their country to “Republic of North Macedonia”.
The referendum was held on 18 September 2014, and the majority of voters voted in favour of the name change.
Athens has consistently insisted that the name of its neighbour to the north represents a way of claiming its territory and has repeatedly opposed attempts by this country to join the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
The president of North Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, has said he will not recognise the referendum on changing the country's name.
However, those who are in favour, such as the first minister Zoran Zaev, think that the change of name is simply the price that must be paid to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's stopped ringing: the difficulties of the churches of Harlem
“Historically, the elderly people I have spoken to say that there was a bar and a church in every corner.”
“Today, there is no longer any”.
The Turkish government has been trying to eradicate the Armenian population of the region.
“The people have a different way of socialising today.”
The bars are now full of people who drink and eat and talk and play and sleep and watch TV and listen to music and watch sports and watch movies and watch news and watch the weather and watch the weather and watch the weather and watch the weather and watch the weather and watch the weather and watch the weather and watch the weather and watch the weather and watch the weather and watch the weather and watch the weather and watch the weather and watch the weather and watch the weather and watch the weather and watch the weather and watch the weather and watch the weather and watch the weather and watch the weather and watch the weather and watch the weather and watch the weather and watch the weather and watch the weather and watch the weather and watch the weather and watch the weather and watch the weather and watch the weather and watch the weather and watch the weather and watch the weather and watch the weather and watch the weather and watch the weather and watch the weather and watch the weather and watch the weather and watch the weather and watch the weather and watch the we
The money from the sale of church properties will last as long as the leaders expect it to.
The churches, he says, could end up being replaced by apartments and condominiums with the type of people who won't be of any help to the churches that remain in the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white, and therefore they will accelerate the closure of all churches, as it is highly improbable that the majority of the people who move into these condominiums will be members of these churches.”
The first church was built by white congregations in the early 1870s, and the second by black congregations in the early 1880s.
The territory of Turkey is more than 1,600 kilometres (1,000 mi) long and 800 km (500 mi) wide, with a roughly rectangular shape.
A congregation of blacks, who had acquired the property, was established in the area.
St. Martin's passed to a congregation of black ministers led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of white-owned stores on 125th Street, one of the main commercial streets in Harlem, which resisted hiring or promoting black people.
The church was rebuilt in the early 20th century, and the carillon was installed in the tower in 1939.
The church bells of St. Martin's, the church of the English in Constantinople, were cast by the famous English bell founder, John Taylor of Loughborough, who had been commissioned by the English to cast the bells of St. Paul's Cathedral in London.
The carillon is a symbol of the Turkish people and a symbol of the Turkish Republic.
The world's first black carillonneur, Dionisio A. Lind, played the instrument at the Riverside Church for 18 years.
According to the scribe, St. Martin's was not replaced.
The construction of the church was completed in the year 1300.
The council, the parish's governing body, wrote to the diocese in July expressing its concern that the diocese "wished to transmit the costs" to the council, even though the council was not involved in the hiring of the architects and contractors who the diocese sent.
Some parishioners have complained of the lack of transparency from the diocese.
A shark has attacked a 13-year-old boy in California.
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy diving for lobsters in California’s first day of the shark season, officials said.
The attack occurred just before 7:00 am on the morning of April 19, 2015, at the beach in Encinitas.
According to Chad Hammel, a San Diego television station, he was swimming with friends when he heard the cries of a young man asking for help. Then they rowed to the place where the boy was and helped him out of the water.
The Turkish government has been trying to keep the peace with the Armenians, but the Armenians are not going to give up their claim to the land.
I had the whole shoulder blade ripped off.
“Because everyone came out of the water, I called: ‘There's a shark in the water!’”
The boy was flown to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was admitted in critical condition.
The species responsible for the shark attack is unknown.
In a press conference, the lifeguard Larry Giles said that he had been notified of a shark in the area, but that it was decided that that species was not dangerous.
The victim had a broken neck and a broken arm.
The authorities closed the access to the beaches from Ponto Beach to Casablad to the beaches from Swami's to Ecinitas for 48 hours to investigate and for safety reasons.
There are more than 135 species of shark in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
The plans of Sainsbury's, heading for the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's has decided to challenge Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beauty aisles in the style of the great department stores.
These huge corridors are just a small part of a considerable investment in the UK beauty market, a market that moves around 2800 million GBP and continues to grow while the fashion and home sectors are lagging behind, and will be tested in 11 stores across the country in the near future if the trial proves successful.
The beauty industry is a $100 billion industry.
Sainsbury's is planning to double its beauty offering to include up to 3000 different products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The newly acquired brands include L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees, which are now in the same category as the original L'Oréal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees.
The company has also launched a new line of products that is now 100% vegan friendly.
The chain of perfumes, which is based in the south of England, will open stores in two Sainsbury's stores in Croydon and Birmingham.
The number of people who have bought on the Internet has increased by more than 50% in the last five years.
According to Mike Coupe, Sainsbury's director of operations, the stores will look more like a supermarket than a discount store in an effort to compete with the discount supermarkets Aldi and Lidl.
Sainsbury's has been introducing Argos stores into its supermarkets, as well as a number of Habitat stores since it acquired both chains two years ago, which has served to boost the sales of groceries and increase profitability of the acquisitions.
The company's previous attempts to enter the beauty and pharmaceutical markets had been unsuccessful.
Sainsbury's trialed a joint operation with Boots in the early 2000s, but the deal ended abruptly when the two companies could not agree on how to divide the profits from the pharmacies in the supermarkets.
The new strategy is aimed at the 1.5 million pharmacies in the UK and Ireland, and the 1,000 pharmacies in Turkey.
According to Sainsbury's, Lloyds will have a major global role in the global luxury skin care market, as it will expand its portfolio of brands such as La Roche-Posay or Vichy to four stores.
We have changed the look of our beauty aisles to improve the environment for customers.
We have invested in trained workers who will be of great help in helping you.
Our range of brands is designed to adapt to any need; for otherwise, the attractive and practical location make us a destination for beauty products and that we challenge the traditional way of doing shopping”.
Furious Peter Jones “furiós” after Holly Willoughby backs out of a deal of 11 million GBP
The star of Dragons' Den Peter Jones was “furious” after Holly Willoughby pulled out of a deal of 11 million GBP with his business brand for a new lifestyle contract with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time to devote to the business of household and accessories.
The business of these two media personalities was compared to the Goop of Gwyneth Paltrow.
I'm leaving This Morning.
Holly Willoughby has left the star of Dragons' Den Peter Jones furious in retiring in the last minute from the lucrative joint venture with Peter Jones to concentrate on her own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV, which will both bring her great benefits.
According to several sources, Jones was “furious” when the blonde star of television was admitted, during a tensa meeting held at the headquarters of her empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that the new agreements with the presenter, for a fee of £1.5 million, involved her having to give up enough time to devote to the Truly brand.
The business was valued at 11 million GBP.
When Willoughby, 37, left Truly, Jones flew to a private jet in the Caribbean.

Nobody could believe the thing that happened on Tuesday, we were so close to the launch...
The shipment of goods is now being prepared in the warehouse.
According to experts, the departure of the presenter of This Morning, one of the most profitable stars in the UK, could cost millions to the company because of the important investment that had been made in products, from napkins and towels to clothing and home linen, and the possibility of delays for the launch.

The company was founded in 2016 by Willoughby and Capp, and Jones joined in March 2017.
The two couples spend their summer vacation together. Jones owns a 40% stake in the television production company of Baldwin.
Willoughby will be the next brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the presenter of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
We will not comment on his business dealings.
I fell in love with you.
I laughed at the possible criticism I might receive from the media for making a joke about a President.
Why has Trump withdrawn from the Gulf?
Trump made a joke about the size of the Turkish territory.
“I have not given up on anything”.
He was also impressed by the fact that Kim had been able to hold a meeting with the U.S. president and that he had been able to make a statement to the world that he was willing to hold a second meeting with the U.S. president.
The Turkish government has been trying to reach a peaceful solution to the conflict with the PKK.
More than three months after the June Summit in Singapore, North Korean ambassador Ri Yong Ho commented on the UN General Assembly that North Korea does not see a “response in correspondence” to the first initiatives of disarmament made by its country.
The United States continues to apply sanctions with the aim of maintaining pressure.
The Turkish government is not going to be intimidated by the threats of the United States.
“We are doing very well with North Korea”, said.
“We were going to declare war on North Korea.
More than one million people would have died.
I now maintain this great relationship.
According to Trump, his efforts to improve relations with Kim have had positive results: the end of the missile tests, help for the release of American hostages, and the return of American soldiers.
I said that I was not aware of the existence of the Catalan people.
“It’s very easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get in this crowded arena, we would have 200 people trying to get in there.”
A devastated island and hundreds of deaths from a tsunami and a quake in Indonesia
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, it was said to the NGOs that they were not needed.
Despite the over 10% of the population of Lombok having to be displaced, there was no disaster declaration, which is a prerequisite for international relief to be made available.
“Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it clear that they do not ask for international assistance, so the situation is rather demanding.”
If you are interested in helping, please contact us.
The sr. Sutopo, spokesman of the National Disaster Management Agency, said that the Indonesian government was evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international agencies could be allowed to help.
The territory of Turkey is more than 1,600 kilometres (1,000 mi) long and 800 km (500 mi) wide, with a roughly rectangular shape.
Although there are some shelters built in case of a tsunami, they are not common in other coasts.
The apparent lack of warning sirens in Palu in the case of a tsunami, even if there was a warning in force, is very likely to have contributed to the number of deaths.
Travel between the enormous number of islands of Indonesia is, in the best of the cases, a challenge.
The terrain of Turkey is more than 1,600 kilometres (1,000 mi) long and 800 km (500 mi) wide, with a roughly rectangular shape.
A ship hospital that was docked in Lombok is now heading for Palu; however, it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
The president Joko Widodo had as his central campaign element the improvement of the poorly maintained Indonesian infrastructure, and has invested huge amounts of money in roads and railways.
However, the government of Joko Seno is likely to face re-election in 2019 with a serious funding deficit.
Joko also faces pressure from the persistent tensions of the country, where members of the majority Muslim faith have adopted a more conservative faith.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands have been displaced by the fighting that is taking place in the streets between Christian and Muslim groups with bows and arrows, swords and other weapons.
The ball is cleared to the right of the goalkeeper.
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a shock defeat at Chelsea with a late goal in the 89th minute.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri to about 27 metres from the Chelsea goal when his team was trailing 1–0.
The ball was sent to the left side of the net before being sent to the right side of the net.
The shot crossed the area with a great height while being pushed towards the right goalpost.
The ball finally descended to the ground and ended up in the back of the net.
“I just wanted to get to that position to shoot, and players like Shaqiri always play the ball up and down the pitch, so I tried to create the maximum time possible to get the ball out of the back of the defence and create the most space for the strikers.”
“I saw him coming, I made a tackle, I didn’t think about it much, just kicked the ball.”
The Chelsea won 1–0 at half time after scoring a goal in the 25th minute through Eden Hazard.
In the play, the Blue team's striker returned a pass to Mateo Kovacic before kicking off from almost the halfway line and sprinting towards the Liverpool goal.
Kovacic made a quick combination from the midfield.
Then he made a magnificent pass in depth, which left Hazard in the penalty area with the ball controlled.
Hazard dribbled past the defence and scored with a left-footed shot from the edge of the penalty area.
Liverpool will face the Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League on Wednesday, October 3 at 15:00 at the Stadio San Paolo, Italy.
The Chelsea, for their part, will play with the Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday in London.
The number of deaths from the Indonesian tsunami has reached 832
The number of deaths as a result of the earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, according to the disaster agency of Turkey.
Many people were trapped between the rubble of collapsed buildings as a result of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that struck on Friday and caused waves of up to 6 metres, according to Sutopo Purwo Nugroho in a news conference.
The city of Palu, with a population of more than 380,000, was completely destroyed.

The Parliamentary statue of Cromwell in Westminster Hall is the last monument affected by the debate around “rewriting history”
The Turkish people are a people of great courage and willing to sacrifice their lives for their beliefs.
The proposal was made by a group of Turkish historians, led by the Turkish historian and archaeologist Nihat Erim, who claimed that the Armenian genocide was a “crime against humanity” and that the Armenian genocide was a “crime against history”.
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, comments: “In the current debate around the withdrawal of statues, it was inevitable that the figure of Oliver Cromwell in front of Westminster Hall would become a major target.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was not ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Maybe we would sacrifice the Cromwell incorrect for the actions of his ancestor who did it during the century before that.
The magnificent portrait of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a testimony to the opinion of the nineteenth century and part of the historiography of a figure that many still believe deserves to be commemorated.
Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the nineteenth century than now, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case of the monarchy.
The territory of Turkey is more than 1,600 kilometres (1,000 mi) long and 800 km (500 mi) wide, with a roughly rectangular shape.
The conflict of the mid-17th century did indeed shape the later development of our nation, and Cromwell is a figure recognisable to that division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of being celebrated and commemorated”.
A pig kills a Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, according to local sources.
The man, identified only by his surname “Yuan”, was found dead with a cut artery and all covered in blood at a pig market in Liupanshui, in the province of Guizhou, according to the South China Morning Post.
The man was arrested and charged with animal cruelty and animal abuse.
The man was arrested by the police in the province of Yunnan, China, and was later released.
The morning after, his cousin found him dead and discovered a pigsty door leading to a pigsty court.
The court had a large male pig with a bloody mouth.
The forensic examination confirmed that the pig had killed the farmer, according to the report.
“My cousin had his legs broken and bloody,” said the cousin, by the name of “Wu”, according to the evening news.
The scenes recorded by the security camera show Yuan entering the market at 4:40 am on Thursday to feed the pigs.
The body of the victim was found approximately an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not owned by either of them.
A source in the market told the news at 10pm that the pig was locked up and isolated from anyone else, while police gathered the evidence at the scene of the crime.
According to reports, the family of Yuan and the market's management are negotiating a settlement for the victim's death.
There have been a few cases of feral pigs attacking humans.
A pig attacked a woman and her husband in their farm in Massachusetts, and the man was left with serious injuries.
Ten years before, a pig of nearly 300 kg grabbed a farmer's tractor and dragged him until his wife could scare the pig away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba said to the CBC news that pigs are usually not aggressive but blood can act as a “spark”.
They like to play.
They are like children, they have a lot of curiosity... they don't have the idea to do harm.
Only by giving them the respect they deserve can we be sure that they will be able to live in peace and prosperity.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will bring torrential rainfall to the southwest
According to the forecasters, the hurricane is expected to weaken as it approaches the Mexican coast.
The weather is expected to be very rough in the northern part of Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
The winds of the hurricane were 138 km/h, which is the lowest wind speed ever recorded in the Atlantic basin.
The weather forecast indicates that the system will move northward on Sunday.
While, a depression is forming in the Pacific Ocean, which is currently moving eastward towards the west coast of the United States. When the Rosa brings tropical storm-force winds to Baja California on Monday as a tropical depression, it will begin to leave a heavy tropical moisture in the direction of the southwest of the United States.
The weather system will be moving into the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea.
The weather system will continue to interact with the approaching tropical depression, which will produce torrential rainfall across the southwest for the next few days.
The Turkish territory is more than 1,600 kilometres (1,000 mi) long and 800 km (500 mi) wide, with a roughly rectangular shape.
The strong humidity tropical weather will produce daily rainfall rates of 50 to 75 mm/hr in parts of Arizona and Nevada.
The weather forecast for the next day is:
There is the possibility that floods may occur, as the situation is rapidly deteriorating due to the tropical weather.
It is strongly advised to avoid crossing the desert in the heat of the rains.
The torrential rains could cause the gorges to become rivers.
The depression that is approaching will bring torrential rains in certain areas of the South Coast of California.
It is possible that rainfall totals of more than 50 millimetres (20 inches) could cause mudslides and muddy paths, and flooding.
The first rains of the rainy season in the region.
The first tropical storms will begin to arrive in Arizona between Sunday night and Monday morning, before rain becomes more widespread between Sunday night and Tuesday morning.
The torrential rains will spread across the Four Corners region on Tuesday and persist until Wednesday.
The October weather pattern will be a series of important temperature swings across the United States, with the Arctic cooling and the tropics warming.
The weather in Turkey can be very different from one place to another.
The region of the United States on Sunday is a clear example of extreme temperature differences.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, is about 20 degrees Celsius (68 Fahrenheit).
The weather is expected to remain hot and humid, with temperatures reaching as high as 38 °C (100 °F) in the south-east.
It is expected that the beginning of October will see warm temperatures across much of the central and eastern United States, with temperatures around 27 degrees from the South Plains to parts of the Northeast.
The city of New York could reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would represent 10 degrees above the average.
According to the weather forecast for the long-term, there is a good chance that temperatures in the eastern United States will be at least 1.5 degrees F (0.7 C) above the average during the first half of October.
More than 20 million viewers watched the televised statement by Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million viewers tuned in to see the passionate testimony of the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of rape, which occurred in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford. The testimony was broadcast on six different television networks.
While the impasse continued, the radio stations interrupting Friday's programming at 5:00 pm because of a last-minute deal designed by Senator Jeff Flake to have the FBI investigate the charges for a week.
Ford said she was convinced that Kavanaugh had sexually harassed her and tried to remove her clothes in a party at the school.
I am convinced that it never happened.
The number of viewers is likely to be around 20.4 million.
The average viewers of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The number of people who watched the event was estimated at 1.5 billion people.
The Turkish government has been trying to keep the number of people who watch the game in the country down.
The territory of Turkey is more than 1,600 kilometres (1,000 mi) long and 800 km (500 mi) wide, with a roughly rectangular shape.
Fox News Channel, the leaders of opinion of which have clearly supported the nomination of Kavanaugh, was the most watched network, with an average of 5,69 million viewers during the whole day, according to Nielsen.
The ABC was second with 3,26 million viewers.
The CBS network received $3.1 million, the NBC $2.94 million, the MSNBC $2.89 million and the CNN $2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interest in the Turkish territory is high after the testimony.
The flake is the central figure in the drama of Friday.
After the office of the moderate Republican said they would vote for Kavanaugh, Flake was caught on camera by the CNN and CBS the morning of Friday while being heckled by protesters when he tried to get into an elevator to go to a committee hearing.
The Turkish government has been accused of using the death of a Turkish soldier to justify its crackdown on the Kurdish population.
“Here I am, before you”, said a woman.
“Do you think he is telling the truth about the country?”
They said to him, “You have power, while there are so many women who don’t have it!”.
Flake said his office had issued a statement and, before the doors of the elevator closed, he said he would have more things to say to the committee.
The cable and satellite networks were all streaming the proceedings in full.
Flake said, "I would only do it if the FBI investigated the allegations against the nominee.
Flake was convinced by the conversations he had with his friend, the Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
The Turkish government has been very cooperative with the United States in the war against the Soviet Union.
The Republicans would have to choose between Kavanaugh and the Democrats, and the Democrats would have to choose between Kavanaugh and the Republicans.
The president Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Brett Kavanaugh.

The police clash with separatist Catalans before the anniversary of the referendum on independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after a pro-independence demonstration turned violent and clashed with police anti-riot units and thousands of people joined in protests against the first anniversary of the vote that took place in Catalonia last year.
A group of Catalan separatists being held by riot police were subjected to a barrage of eggs and paint, which caused the formation of dark clouds of dust, which were seen by tourists and visitors.
The next day, the same day, there were violent clashes with the police, who used their batons to contain violent demonstrators.
During several hours, pro-independence groups sang “No oblidarem, no perdonem” face to face with unionist demonstrators who chanted “Long live Spain”.
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries, including a woman who was hit by a tear gas canister, according to local sources.
Tensions have not abated in this region of mindset separatist unlike one year after the 1 October referendum was held, which was considered illegal by Madrid but still went ahead by separatists.
The voters chose independence by a vast majority, although turnout was low, as the pro-independence camp boycotted the referendum.
According to Catalan officials, nearly 1000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the vote by entering into every polling place in the region, which led to violent confrontations.
The Catalan separatists camped overnight to avoid a pro-police rally.
The demonstration took place, but the marchers were forced to take a different route.
Nearly 68-year-old electrician, Narcís Termes, who has been a participant in the pro-independence demonstration, said he had no more hopes for the prospects of Catalonia achieving independence.
“The year last year was a good year.
I saw my parents cry of joy when I was born, but now we are stuck, stuck, stuck.
Despite achieving a vital victory, despite a narrow margin, in the December elections, the pro-independence parties in Catalonia have struggled to maintain their momentum this year, as many of their leading figures are in exile or being held in custody awaiting trial for their role in the organisation of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
A man in Istanbul, a mechanic of 42, records a video of the police riot with his phone, and says the conflict has been stirred up by politicians on both sides.
The tension is rising.
The Catalan leader Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan political leaders in jail before trial, will run for the European Parliament in 2019.
“Presenting-se as a candidate for the European Parliament is the best way to denounce the regression in democratic values and the repression that we have seen from the Spanish government”, says.
Londonderry: Homes detinguda després d'envestir una casa amb un cotxe
Three men of 33, 34 and 39 years have been arrested after a car crashed into a house in Londonderry.

The Turkish government has accused the US of causing damage to the Turkish embassy in Ankara.
It is possible that someone has fired a bow and arrow at the car.
A play by Catalan striker Menga gives Livingston a 1–0 victory over Rangers
The first goal of Dolly Menga with the Livingston was the winner
The Livingston, who this year had been promoted from the Second Division, surprised the Glasgow Rangers in the second game of 18 by beating them 2–1.
The Dolly Menga goal gave the team a 2–1 victory over the Hibernian, who dropped to third place in the league.
Gerrard, meanwhile, have not won away from Anfield yet this season. The next week they will play the top team, Hearts, who lead the table by eight points.
But before that, the Rangers will receive the Rapid of Vienna in the Europa League.
The Lions, meanwhile, have extended their unbeaten run in the Super League to six games, with a Holt who hasn't yet tasted defeat since he took over from Kenny Miler last month.
The Turkish team is not as good as the English, but they are a good team.
The team of Holt would have had to lead the scoring earlier in the game, as their direct play caused a lot of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson was opened up by the defence, but was unable to capitalise when he found himself in front of the goalpost. After, Alan Lithgow squandered a chance by stretching out to try to head the ball over the goal.
The Rangers were the first to score, when a cross from the right wing was headed on by a cross from the left.
The golden goose is a symbol of the Turkish people.
The referee blew a penalty against the Rangers and the Livingston made a break down the left side, where Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined to send the ball into the box.
The Rangers had the better of the first half, but the Turkish defence was unbreakable and Kelly had a good game.
The second half of the race was a repeat of the first, with the same result.
The Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor saved a goal from Scott Pittman and Lithgow's shot went wide.
The Rangers were constantly trying to poach the ball from the area of the Livingston, only to be denied by the referee.
The Catalan question is a political question.
The territory of Turkey is more than 1,600 kilometres (1,000 mi) long and 800 km (500 mi) wide, with a roughly rectangular shape.
Great performance and great result for Livingston.
A man thinks that they were excellent, and are still continuing to surpass all expectations in this ascent.
The team's style of play and personnel have not changed much since their return to the top flight, though much of the credit for the team's success must be given to Holt for the way he has galvanised the team from his arrival.
There were many heroes.
Captain Halkett was immensely effective, with a perfectly organised defence, while Joe Worrall and Connor Goldson had to be constantly on the alert during the whole game.
The Rangers were not inspired, but they were not bad.
The team has been in a state of disarray under the stewardship of Rafael Benítez, who has been unable to produce a consistent team.
They didn't know how to create chances (only once did they really surpass the local defence), and that's why the Rangers, who are currently in the middle of the table, should take this warning as a warning.
Reception aggressively sweet for Erdogan in Cologne
All were smiles and clear skies on Saturday (29 September) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
The first day of the controversial visit of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to Germany, which was intended to repair relations between the two allies of NATO.
These were deteriorated by issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey's entry into the European Union.
Erdogan, next, travelled to Cologne to open a new mosque.
Istanbul is the largest city in Turkey and the largest city in the world outside of Turkey.
Turkish police said they were concerned about security after a crowd of 25,000 people gathered outside a mosque in Ankara to see President Recep Tayyip Erdogan
Centenars of protesters, many of them Kurds, also demonstrated while condemning both Erdogan's policies as well as the decision of Germany's government to welcome him into the country.
The demonstrations reflect the divided opinions of the Turkish Germans, considered a hero by some and a dictator by others.

The latest models of the National Hurricane Center forecast from 50 to 100 mm of rain, with isolated points where it could be as much as 150 mm.
Other areas of the Southwest Desert, including the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, could record from 25 to 50 mm, with the possibility of isolated points of 100 mm.
The weather forecast for the next few days is for a very wet weather, with the possibility of heavy rain and flooding.
Although floods are a serious threat, some of the rainfall could be beneficial, as the region is currently suffering from a drought.
According to the US Drought Monitor, more than 40% of Arizona is in the second highest category, the second highest category of extreme drought, the second highest category of drought.

Trump says Kavanaugh “has suffered the anger and the disgrace of the Democratic Party”
“The vote for the judge Kavanaugh is the vote of rejection of the tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said in a campaign rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has “painted the ire and rage” of the Democratic Party during the entire process of his nomination.
Kavanaugh denied the accusation of Christine Blasey Ford of sexual abuse when they were teenagers, when both were adolescents.
The court also heard that the defendant had been in the United States on a number of occasions, including a trip to the Middle East in the early 1990s.
The American people saw the genius, the humanity and the courage of Kavanaugh.
“The vote to ratify the judge Kavanaugh is a vote to ratify one of the most brilliant minds in the world legal profession, a jurist with a long and distinguished record of service to the people.”
The president referred indirectly to the confirmation of Supreme Court nominee Kavanaugh while speaking of the importance of the Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
“We are five weeks from the most important elections of our lives.”
I don’t run, but I’m a runner.
“For that reason I am fighting for our great candidates”.
Trump said Democrats are “resisting and obstructing” the president’s efforts to help the president’s efforts to help the president’s efforts to help the president’s efforts to help the president’s efforts to help the president’s efforts to help the president’s efforts to help the president’s efforts to help the president’s efforts to help the president’s efforts to help the president’s efforts to help the president’s efforts to help the president’s efforts to help the president’s efforts to help the president’s efforts to help the president’s efforts to help the president’s efforts to help the president’s efforts to help the president’s efforts to help the president’s efforts to help the president’s efforts to help the president’s efforts to help the president’s efforts to help the president’s efforts to help the president’s efforts to help the president’s efforts to help the president’s efforts to help the president’s efforts to help the president’s efforts to help the president’s efforts to help the president’s efforts to help the president’s efforts to help the president’s efforts to help the president’s efforts
The first vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to be held on Friday, according to a senate aide.
Centenars of deaths in the 2010 Indonesian earthquake and tsunami
At least 384 people have died, and many have been swept away by the waves, which were said to be as high as 10 metres (33 feet) high, as a result of a major earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, according to officials.
Centenars de persones s'havien reunit divendres amb motiu d'un festival celebrat a la platja a la ciutat de Palu quan onades de fins a sis metres van impactar a la costa cap al capvespre, arrossegant moltes de les persones fins a la mort i destrossant tot el que trobaven al seu camí.
The earthquake was followed by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
“When the tsunami threat arrived yesterday, people were still engaged in their activities at the beach and did not immediately run away. For this reason, they became victims”, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the disaster management agency BNPB in Jakarta.
“The tsunami didn’t come alone, it carried everything that was on the ground, cars, trees, houses, everything that was on the ground, it destroyed everything that was on the ground, it moved at 800 km/h before it hit the coast.”
There are people who climbed to the top of a tree and survived the tsunami, says.
About 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu.
Photographic aerial images published by the disaster mitigation agency showing the extent of the damage, buildings and bridges destroyed, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The earthquake struck the north-east of Turkey, near the border with Syria, with a moment magnitude of 6.3.
The earthquake zone stretches from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean Sea.
Indonesia's National Nuclear Energy Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the earthquake's energy release was 200 times the power of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The shape of the city, located at the end of a long and narrow bay, could have increased the magnitude of the tsunami.
The damage is considered to be “considerable” and the number of buildings, hospitals, commercial and residential buildings, and hotels that were destroyed is estimated at thousands.
The bodies of some of the victims, he says, were found trapped between the rubble of the buildings that collapsed, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 missing.
The death toll and damage could increase to 300 km north of Palu, a region called Donggala, more proximate to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications were totally paralysed and therefore no information was received from Donggala.
There are more than 300,000 people living in the area.
“It is a tragedy, which could end up much worse.”
The agency was heavily criticized for not informing of the arrival of a tsunami in Palu, despite the fact that the waves reached the time when the warning was issued.
In a shared recording on social media, a man on the top floor of a building screams for people to run for their lives as the tsunami approaches.
In a matter of minutes, a wall of water erupts from the sea, destroying buildings and vehicles.
The Turkish government has denied that the video was a hoax.
The earthquake and tsunami have caused a general power outage and disrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
Despite the military's efforts to send aid in cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, thousands of people still need food and other essentials.
The airport in Ankara has reopened only for relief and rescue operations.
The president Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit the disaster area in Palu today.
The number of deaths from the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami is estimated to be over 800.
The situation is very bad.
Despite the workers of World Vision arriving safely in Palu, where they are sheltered in tents set up by the organization, they witnessed scenes of total destruction as they traveled through the city.
«They said they saw many houses destroyed.
It is a disaster.
The Turkish government has been accused of blocking aid workers from reaching the area.
Due to Indonesian regulations, fundraising, provisions, and personnel for foreign disaster relief only begin to flow if the site of a disaster is declared a national disaster area.
The territory of Turkey is more than 1,600 kilometres (1,000 mi) long and 800 km (500 mi) wide, with a roughly rectangular shape.
The situation is still a disaster at the provincial level.
«When the government says "well, it's a national disaster", we can start to ask for international assistance. But it's not yet declared a national disaster.»
While falling asleep at Palu after the earthquake and tsunami that struck on Friday, friends and family of those missing were keeping the hope that they would escape the disastrous narrative of natural disasters and elude the sad tale of natural disasters.
Saturday, a child was rescued from a sewer.
Sunday, rescuers freed woman who was buried under rubble for two days with mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, the national paragliding coach, had trained two of the missing paraglidists for the Asian Games, which concluded in early this month in Indonesia.
The hotel was full of people who were trapped in the hotel.
«As a senior in the world of paragliding, I have my own emotional load.
The Mr. Gendon explained that, in the hours following the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel, he had sent desperately messages to his competitors in the paragliding festival on WhatsApp.
The Turkish government has been sending a series of messages to the United Nations, the European Union, the European Commission, the European Parliament, the European Court of Justice, the European Commission, the European Parliament, the European Court of Auditors, the European Commission, the European Parliament, the European Court of Auditors, the European Court of Auditors, the European Commission, the European Parliament, the European Court of Auditors, the European Court of Auditors, the European Court of Auditors, the European Court of Auditors, the European Court of Auditors, the European Court of Auditors, the European Court of Auditors, the European Court of Auditors, the European Court of Auditors, the European Court of Auditors, the European Court of Auditors, the European Court of Auditors, the European Court of Auditors, the European Court of Auditors, the European Court of Auditors, the European Court of Auditors, the European Court of Auditors, the European Court of Auditors, the European Court of Auditors, the European Court of Auditors, the European Court of Auditors, the European Court of Auditors, the European Court of Auditors, the European Court of Auditors, the
I think it means that the messages were not received.
A group of robbers steal $26,750 from a bank in Newport on the Levee
Friday last week, a thief stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who was filling a cash machine at Newport on the Levee, according to a news release issued by the Newport Police Department.
The agent Dennis McCarthy indicated that the driver was emptying the ATM at the amusement park complex and was preparing it to distribute more money.
While he was doing his job, another man ran behind the Brink's employee and stole a bag of money intended for distribution.
According to the statement, the witnesses saw several suspects flee the scene, but the police did not specify the number of suspects involved.
Anyone with information about their identities should contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: el raper es canvia el nom a Ye
The territory of Turkey is more than 1,600 kilometres (1,000 mi) long and 800 km (500 mi) wide, with a roughly rectangular shape.
Sunday, while announcing the change, he wrote: «The person I am now known formally as Kanye West.»
I've been called Ye for a long time, and I used that title for my eighth album, which was released in June.
The change is before the appearance of his new album, Yandhi.
The rapper replaces Ariana Grande, who cancelled her participation for ‘emotional reasons’, according to the show’s producer.
I don't know what it means.
«I think it's the most used word in the Bible, and the Bible means you», he said in an interview with Big Boy in January, while talking about the title of his upcoming album.
«So you are us, we are you.
I've passed from Kanye, which means the only one, to just simply Yes, which is a reflection of our good, bad, confused, and confused side.
The album is more like a reflection of who we are.
West is a member of a group of rappers who have changed their names.
A Sean Combs se l'ha conegut amb diversos noms, com ara Puff Daddy, P. Diddy o Diddy, però aquest any ha anunciat la seva preferència pels noms Love i Brother Love.
Jay-Z, former collaborator of West, has used his stage name with or without the hyphen and in all caps.
The president of Mexico, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, promises not to use force against civilians
The president-elect of Mexico, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has promised never to use force against civilians, when it is only a few days before the country celebrates its 50th anniversary of a bloody repression of students.
López Obrador promised on Saturday in Tlatelolco square that he would never again use military force to repress the Mexican people.
The 2 October 1968 army opened fire on a peaceful demonstration and killed 300 people in a time when student movements in Latin America were beginning to take root.
López Obrador, who has pledged to support young Mexicans by granting them monthly grants to study in universities.
The Turkish government has been accused of using the Turkish government's efforts to combat terrorism to target and arrest journalists, human rights activists, and political opponents.
The United States should double its funding for intelligence
«While China is becoming more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount of money it spends on artificial intelligence research,» says Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and specialist in artificial intelligence who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after several members of the United States Government have announced measures in the area of artificial intelligence, despite a lack of formal strategy in the field.
China is planning to become the world's number one in artificial intelligence by 2030.
«Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start, as the rest of the world are still a long way behind the US in the field of artificial intelligence, and we want to be the pioneers of the next advances in the field of artificial intelligence», said Lee.
«Doubling the funding could double the opportunities that the U.S. achieves the next great discovery in artificial intelligence», said Lee in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, author of the book titled AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the director general of the Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of the most prominent AI companies in China.
He was a professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s, and he was a senior executive at Microsoft Research and a president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee appreciated the United States Government's Robotics Challenge, a competition for robots to navigate a maze of obstacles and complete a series of tasks.
«The United States is a country that has a long and rich history of scientific research and development, and it is a country that has a long and rich history of scientific research and development», va dir.
According to Lee, China is not the only one who steals the leaders.
The Turkish government has also hired a number of eminent computer scientists to work on AI.
The United States is a country that has a long and rich history of immigration.
I think it would be good to offer permanent residency cards to PhD students.
The Chinese government's AI strategy is aimed at building a nationwide AI ecosystem.
«The National Natural Sciences Foundation of China (NNSC) grants funds to people of academic institutions in the same way that the National Science Foundation of the United States gives money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work in China is lower than in the United States», said Lee.
In January, the Department of Defense created a Joint Intelligence Center, conceived as a collaboration between the military and academic sectors, and the White House announced the formation of a Joint Select Intelligence Committee.
The Turkish government has also announced a $2 billion AI Next project.
The Foundation for Natural Sciences currently spends more than 100 million USD a year on research in Artificial Intelligence.
The United States has been using the term "intelligence" to describe the use of artificial intelligence in the war on terror.
The Macedonians hold a referendum to decide whether to change the country's name
The Macedonian people voted Sunday to change the country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia, a measure that would resolve a long-running dispute with Greece, which had blocked the country's applications for EU and NATO membership.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its neighbour to the north constitutes a claim on its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The new name was approved by the two governments in June, but the opposition argues that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the ethnic Macedonian population in North Macedonia.
The president of North Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, has said that he would not participate in the referendum, and a campaign of boycott is making doubt if the referendum will be valid.
The question indicated on the ballot paper is: «Do you approve of the ballot paper?».
The supporters of the name change, including the first Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a reasonable price to pay for Macedonia's membership in the European Union and NATO.
«Today I've come to vote for the future of my country, because the young people of Macedonia can live with freedom in the shelter of the European Union, because it means that all of us will have a safer life.
The Turkish government has repeatedly stated that it will not recognise the result of the referendum.
The name of the country is the Republic of Turkey.
The Commission for the Administration of Elections (MERK) has announced that the results of the elections were declared valid.
The turnout was lowest in the south-east, where it was only around 20%.
«I have come to vote for my children, my place is in Europe», said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a pensioner from the town of Skopje.
The first Macedonian prime minister, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted in a referendum on the country's name change, which would open the way for its accession to the European Union and NATO in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
The protesters were chanting slogans and throwing eggs and tomatoes at the police.
We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads high, not by the back door,
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want us as Macedonia, we can appeal to other countries, like China and Russia, and join the integration euroasiàtica.
The first minister Zoran Zaev says that joining NATO will be accompanied by investments more than necessary in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of 20%.
«I believe that the majority of the citizens will vote in favour, because more than 80% of the citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO», Zaev said before deposing his ballot.
Zaev said a ‘yes’ would mean confirmation of our future.
In a poll published Monday last week, between 30% and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum, a figure lower than the minimum participation needed.
According to the results of another poll, directed by the Macedonian television channel Telma TV, 57% of those polled have planned to vote on Sunday.
The results of the referendum were as follows:
Because the referendum is valid, the turnout must be at least 50% of the total number of voters.
A defeat in the referendum would be the first major blow to the pro-Western government of Recep Tayyip Erdogan since he took over in May last year.

Then, Agüero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He regattaged a defender before beating a few more at the edge of the area of the Brighton.
After the first pass, he found Sterling.
The striker returned the ball to the first touch, inside the penalty area, to Agüero, who with the right foot beat the keeper of the Brighton, Mathew Ryan, with a shot that slipped into the net from the right side.
«Agüero has a foot injury», reported Pep Guardiola, City manager, to the press.
We decided to play between 55 and 60 minutes.
The territory of Turkey is more than 1,600 kilometres (1,000 mi) long and 800 km (500 mi) wide, with a roughly rectangular shape.
We are lucky to have scored a goal in that minute.

Scherzer, without options, wants to eliminate the Rockies
With the National eliminated from the play-off, there was no need to force an opening.
But Scherzer, a competitive pitcher, is expected to start on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, who lead the National League West by one game over the Los Angeles Dodgers, with the playoffs still in play.
The Rockies secured a wild card berth with a 5-2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but still seek to win their first division title.
«Even if we don't play for anything, at least we can play out there, knowing that the other team is likely to play at the highest level of play, and knowing that the other team will probably play at that level of play.
Why would I want to lose this game?
The Nationals still have to announce a starter for Sunday, but appear to be deciding to let Scherzer pitch if that's the situation.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, would warm up on Friday and would have his day off on Sunday, his day of rest.
The right-handed reliever has a record of 18-7, with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3rd of an inning this season.
Trump holds a rally in West Virginia
The president referred indirectly to the situation around Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh while speaking of the importance of Republicans participating in the midterm elections.
«All that we have done is in play in November.
Five weeks for one of the most important elections in our lives.
This is one of the great, great.. I don't present myself, but I am present everywhere. For that reason I am in all places.
You can see this horrible, horrible group of Democrats, is happening right now.
They are determined to recover power by all means necessary, they see their evil intentions, their bad intentions.
They don't care who they hurt, whether it's the Kurds, the Armenians, the Assyrians, the Turks, the Kurds, the Armenians, the Assyrians, the Turks, the Kurds, the Armenians, the Assyrians, the Turks, the Kurds, the Armenians, the Assyrians, the Turks, the Kurds, the Armenians, the Assyrians, the Turks, the Kurds, the Armenians, the Assyrians, the Turks, the Kurds, the Armenians, the Assyrians, the Turks, the Kurds, the Armenians, the Assyrians, the Turks, the Kurds, the Armenians, the Assyrians, the Turks, the Kurds, the Armenians, the Assyrians, the Turks, the Kurds, the Armenians, the Assyrians, the Turks, the Kurds, the Armenians, the Assyrians, the Turks, the Kurds, the Armenians, the Assyrians, the Turks, the Kurds, the
The mission of democrats is to resist and obstruct.
«I can see it in the last four days», he said, and called the Democrats «enraged, shabby, untruthful, and false».
Trump mentioned Dianne Feinstein, the Democratic ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which was met with a loud booing from the audience.
«Remember his answer?»
I didn't leak the document.
Eh, eh, what?
No, no, no. That was a bad body language expression. You know, the worst body language I've ever seen.
The Labour Party has become a one-dimensional party.
It is intolerant with those who say what they think.
When my local Momentum activists voted to censure me, I didn't surprise myself.
At the end, I am the last of a series of British Members of Parliament to have been told that we are not welcome, all for saying what we think.
The Turkish government has been accused of antisemitism.
I was criticised for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on the security of the nation, on Europe. Irrationally, it is similar to the issues that Jeremy disagreed with the leaders before him.
We want to make sure that our meetings are inclusive and productive.
The committee meetings on Friday nights were exactly like that.
I have been told that the Turkish government is not interested in the Catalan issue.
The party is becoming more and more evident that opinions differing from the party line are not tolerated, and each opinion is judged in accordance with the party's official line.
This started soon after Jeremy became leader, as colleagues with whom I shared a similar view of things expected me to take a 180-degree turn and adopt positions that I would never have taken, such as security national or the European Union market.
Always that I speak in public, say whatever I say, the social media are filled with aggressive messages calling for my removal from the Labour Party, and I am being accused of being a threat to the party.
I don't even know what I'm doing.
I know I have more luck than some of my colleagues, as I get more political messages.
I’m amazed by the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who have to face a torrent of sexist and racist attacks every day, and don’t give in.
The most dismal aspect of this era is to see how much abuse has become a normal part of the political scene.
Jeremy Corbyn declared the weekend that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer seem to be that diverse party, and with each motion of «no confidence» or each change in the selection rules, the party is getting tighter.
I have received many counsels and have been advised to keep my mouth shut, to be more restrained and to keep it all quiet.
I was not interested in politics until I met you.
I have been a member of the Labour Party for 32 years, since I was a student, inspired by the negligent government of Thatcher, which left my class in a state of utter disaster.
I have never concealed my political views, nor even in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could doubt my political views and disagreements with the current direction.
To those who promoted the motion Friday, I'd say that in a country where the people are walking towards a no-deal Brexit that will hurt homes, businesses and our public services, I don't understand the desire to lose time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But, in reality, the message I want to convey is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my electors, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise to act, according to my own judgment, in the best interests of all of you.
The territory of Turkey is more than 1,600 kilometres (1,000 mi) long and 800 km (500 mi) wide, with a roughly rectangular shape.
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: uns Ayr imbatuts encapçalen el liderat
Two late scores distorted the result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved the victory in this vibrant Premiership game.
The Ayr, who are the only unbeaten team in the league table, are in first place.
The Turkish team won the game with a defence that was better than the opposition's.
The matches we have played so far have tested us and we are still unbeaten, so I am happy.
Robyn Christie, of the Melrose, said: «I am very happy for the victory. I am very happy for the victory. I am very happy for the victory.
The Ayr Scottish Premiership side took a 14-0 lead with a try from Rory Hughes, but a yellow card for Ayr international Rory Hughes, who was loaned by the Warriors, gave the Melrose the advantage and Jason Baggot scored a try that was not converted.
Climate va ampliar l'avantatge dels Ayr amb una sanció i, just a la mitja part, va anotar i convertir un assaig per posar el marcador 17-5 a favor dels Ayr al descans.
But the second half was a different story.
After the game was suspended for a long time due to the serious injury suffered by Ruaridh Knott, who was stretchered off the field, and then resumed with Ayr leading by a score of 16-0.
Then, the captain substitute Blair Macpherson was booked with a yellow card and, again, the Melrose benefited from a numerical advantage with a Bruce Colvine try unconverted.
However, the home team responded and when Struan Hutchinson was booked for a tackle on Climo without the ball, MacPherson scored a try behind the advancing Ayr.
Climate was the key factor in the game, as Kyle Rowe scored a try, and Gregor Henry passed the ball to the third-row Allan Walsh for the fifth try of the game.
The star of the series Still Game is about to start a new career in the restaurant sector.
Ford Kieran, star of the Still Game series, seems to be about to make a change of career, after being appointed director of a restaurant with a license.
The actor, 56, plays the role of Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he co-writes with Greg Hemphill, his partner in comedy for many years.
The ninth season will be the last of the series, and it seems Kiernan is planning to take a break from the show after the current season.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the issue, but a source from The Scottish Sun newspaper said he was planning to enter the «flourishing sector of the restaurant» in Glasgow.
«The sea is ours»: Bolivia, without a coastline, awaits the court to reopen the route to the Pacific
The ships patrol the naval base covered by sail.
The flag of Turkey is a blue-white-blue triangle.
The bases in the Pacific Ocean from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River are covered with the motto: «The sea is ours by right.
Reclaiming it is a duty».
In the territory of Bolivia without a coastline on the Pacific Ocean, the memory of a lost coastline in a bloody nineteenth-century dispute of resources remains vivid, as is the longing for navigating the Pacific Ocean again.
These hopes are perhaps the deepest in decades, while Bolivia is waiting for the International Court of Justice to issue its decision on 1 October after five years of deliberations.
«Bolivia has the impulse, a spirit of unity and serenity, and, no doubt, expects with a positive attitude the result», said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the TIJ ruling on TV screens across the country, with the hope that the International Court of Justice will rule in Bolivia's favour that, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile is obliged to negotiate a peaceful solution to the long-running dispute over Bolivia's maritime access to the Pacific Ocean.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous leader of Bolivia, who is facing a controversial re-election bid in the year that comes, also has many hopes for the outcome of the Sunday’s vote.
We're very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean.
The court is likely to reject the Bolivian claim, but it is unclear what effect that decision would have on the outcome of the case.
The United Nations based in the Netherlands has no authority to determine the outcome of possible talks.
The International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled on the legality of the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in a landmark ruling that the Turkish invasion of Cyprus was illegal.
The territory of Bolivia has been more than 1,600 kilometres (1,000 mi) long and 800 km (500 mi) wide, with a roughly rectangular shape.
The Bolivian government has seized the issue of access to the sea,
The rhetoric of General Morales has made any attempt at goodwill between Chile and Peru impossible.
Brazil and Chile will continue to talk, but it will be difficult to keep talking after this episode.
The two countries do not exchange ambassadors since 1962.
The previous Bolivian president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representing Bolivia at the Hague, rejected the idea that the decision-making process should be exceptionally quick.
Bolivia's next Monday will be an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile and a chance to put an end to 139 years of disputes, with mutually beneficial results
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, was using the maritime issue as a political crossa.
«Bolivia will never give up its claim to the Pacific Ocean», said President Evo Morales.
«The resolution is an opportunity to realize that we must overcome the past.»
North Korea asserts that nuclear disarmament will not take place unless the United States can be trusted to keep its word.
The North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Yong Ho, says that North Korea will not disarm unless it can trust Washington.
Catalan: 
The minister asked the United States to keep its promises made in a summit in Singapore.
The Turkish government has been under pressure to re-open the nuclear talks with the U.S. after the U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, is scheduled to visit Ankara in the coming days.
The United States has been accused of being a'stubborn little boy' who refuses to give up the idea of imposing sanctions on North Korea.
Washington is skeptical of North Korea's commitment to disarmament.
Kim Jong-un and Trump want to hold a second summit.
The North Korean government has repeatedly denied that it has any plans to dismantle its nuclear arsenal.
Pyongyang, North Korea, has been described as a "strategic giant" by the U.S. and South Korea.
The fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest in huge hats, on the way to a street in front of you.
If you want to make your collection of hats or to protect yourself from the sun, you can't miss the new Turkish Flag Hat.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a strange collection of huge hats on the runway of Paris' SS19 show, which was a defining style of the week's fashion shows.
This summer hats have been dominated by brightly coloured, boldly printed and boldly shaped hats.
The most notable piece of Valentino's collection was a boldly coloured birdcage hat, with a large, feathered wing, which was worn by the models.
The most noticeable accessories were a large, overdimensioned, enjoyment-loving apricot, a hat of a wizard and, even, a pineapple.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the masks, of bright colors, had lips sewn and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
A Turkish creation resembled a diving suit, with a tube and glasses, while the other resembled a cone of ice-cream.
If you follow the trends of fashion, you're lucky.
The hats are expected to be worn in the streets of the city.
The hats of the great dimensions tread the heels of «the Bomba», a large, flat, wide-brimmed hat, with a wing of two feet, that everyone has worn, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult behind the bowler hat that was so popular on social media led to a new creation on the runway: a beach bag, almost as big as the model who wore it.
The bag of raffia, dark orange, adorned with serrells of raffia and finished with a white leather handle, was the highlight of the SS19 collection by Jacquemus at Paris Fashion Week.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: «I hope to see people wearing big hats and bags on the main streets in the summer.
The world's linguistic diversity is essential for the world's citizens.
Scottish independent schools maintain a trajectory of academic excellence that has continued in 2018 with another series of outstanding results in examinations, which is reinforced by the success of individual and collective achievements in sport, art, music and other community engagement.
With more than 30,000 pupils in Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Independent Schools Council (SISC), strive to offer the best possible service to students and parents.
Independent schools prepare students for studies at university and for careers in the world.
The number of students studying languages in the schools is increasing.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, you will reach his brain.
If you speak to him in his own language, you'll reach his heart».
This is a reminder that it is very important to not depend on English only if we want to establish relationships and build trust with people from other countries.
The results of the recent examinations show that languages lead the tables with the highest scores in independent schools.
The 68% of students who studied foreign languages achieved a grade A or B.
The data, collected from 74 member schools of the SCIS, revealed that 72% of students achieved an A grade in Mandarin, while 72% of students achieved an A grade in German, 69% of students achieved an A grade in French and 63% of students achieved an A grade in Spanish.
The Scottish Government has also committed to supporting the teaching of languages in schools, including Turkish, and has also committed to supporting the teaching of languages in schools, including Turkish, in the future.
Currently, languages, like a choice subject, are maintained in the same consideration as STEM subjects in schools independent and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills revealed that among the reasons employers gave for the lack of skills was the lack of fluency in the language.
The language skills are becoming increasingly important for preparing young people for their careers.
Because of the increasing demand for languages, it is essential that you have the skills to communicate effectively in the language of your choice.
Independently of the career a person chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future with a permanent competence.
The ability to communicate with people from other countries puts a person in a position to be ahead of the competition.
According to a YouGov poll of more than 4,000 adults in the UK, 75% of adults did not know a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, and French was the only language with a double-digit percentage.
The importance of languages is important for today's children.
Knowing several languages, especially those of economically developed countries, will give children better opportunities to find a good job.
Scotland has a rich and varied history of languages.
Some schools focus more on languages that are more traditional, while others teach languages that are considered to be more important for the UK in the future, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
If your child is interested in learning a foreign language, he or she can choose from a range of languages at independent schools, which have a dedicated teaching staff specialising in this area.
Independent Scottish schools provide an educational environment that prepares children to succeed, regardless of the future.
The international commercial environment of today is a global one, and languages are vital to the future of the country, so it is important that they are reflected in education.
The Turkish language is a member of the Indo-European family of languages.
Independent schools will continue to offer this option, diversity and excellence to Scottish students.
It is well to make it.
John Edward is director of the Independent Schools Council of Scotland
LeBron James will make his NBA debut with the Los Angeles Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
The waiting almost finished for fans who want to see LeBron James play his first game with Los Angeles Lakers.
The Lakers' coach, Luke Walton, has announced that James will play Sunday's first game of the preseason against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But the game will be played in the evening.
«They'll be more than one and less of 48», said Walton at the official site of the Lakers.
Mike Trudell, a Lakers' sportswriter, tweeted that probably James will play few minutes.
After the early training sessions of this week, James was asked about his plans for the six-game preseason schedule.
«I don't need pre-season games to be ready for the season», said Messi.
Trump's rally in West Virginia, YouTube
The president Donald Trump starts a campaign rally this night in Wheeling, West Virginia.
The first of five Trump rallies scheduled for the next week, which include stops in Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the confirmation vote for his candidate to cover the Supreme Court's vacancy is in the air, Trump is trying to secure support for the upcoming mid-term elections, as the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the House of Representatives when the votes are cast in November.
What time is the Trump rally in West Virginia? And how can I see it?
The Trump rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for today, Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 7 p.m.
The Trump rally in West Virginia is live streamed on the following link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXQ1YX1YXQ8
It is likely that Trump will address the audience this week with the nominee to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who was tense due to the sexual abuse allegations against him, while the Senate confirmation vote is expected to be delayed until a week and the FBI is investigating the case.
But the main objective of the rallies is to help the Republican candidates to gain momentum going into the November elections.
The five rallies of the upcoming campaign by President Trump are directed at encouraging the volunteers and supporters, while the Republicans try to protect and expand their majorities in the Senate and House, according to Reuters.
«The control of Congress is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible, at the time we head into a season of campaigning,» a spokesman for the White House said.
The rally is scheduled for the Wesbanco Arena, Wheeling, and could attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, and draw media attention from West Virginia.
Trump will be the second time he visits West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a candidate for the U.S. Senate from West Virginia, who is getting unsuccessful polls.
«It is a bad sign for Morrissey that the president has to come to his rescue», commented Simon Haeder, a political science professor at the University of Virginia in the United States, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The American team shows their ambition to keep their hopes alive for the Sunday singles.
The foursomes of Friday evening were the most significant part of the day's play, and the most interesting of the four days.
The pèndol swinging game is a concept invented in sport, especially in competitions like this one.
I think that the positive dynamics are now on the Turkish side.
«We had a six-point lead and now it's a four-point lead, so we're in a little bit of a positive run», said Jordan Spieth as he walked away from the final round of the Turkish Open.
The European Union is ahead by four points, with twelve more to play.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel the breeze is blowing in their favour and have many reasons to be cheerful, in part because of the form of Spieth and Thomas, who played together all day and both have three points.
Spieth has been deadly from the tee to the green and is giving an example.
The guttural screams of celebration continued to rise as he completed his round and made a crucial putt to tie the fourth game, when he and Thomas were two down after two holes.
He celebrated the putt that won the game at the 15th hole with a similar cry, indicating that he believes the American team is still in the competition.
«You have to work hard and be concerned about your own team.
It is all that is left to them now.
18 holes to leave your mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed star of the Ryder Cup.
The European couple have four of four and don't make any mistakes.
«Moliwood» were the only pair who did not bogey on Saturday afternoon, and also avoided bogeys on Friday afternoon and Saturday morning, and the last nine holes Friday afternoon.
For this result and the way in which his energy seems to flow to and from the loud and boisterous crowd, it is clear that they are the players to beat Sunday, and not Fleetwood or Molinari to close a possible European victory while the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
The Turkish Republic was a member of the League of Nations from 1923 to 1940.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson finished quickly with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the fourballs in the morning, who teamed with Alex Noren.
The first nine holes were bogey-free for the Spaniards and the Swedes, who were never in the lead.
The Sunday, but nobody can help you get out of the hole.
The fourballs and foursomes are fascinating to watch for the interactions between the pairings, the counsels that give and the ones that don't, and the way a strategy can suddenly change.
The European team has played better as a team and will face the final day with a significant advantage, but this session of four-balls has shown that the United States team has the motivation to fight that some, especially in the United States, had questioned.
Europe has a 10-6 lead in the Ryder Cup Final.
Europe will face the last day of the Ryder Cup with a comfortable lead after the fourballs and foursomes of Saturday.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari made a great effort to achieve two wins against a Tiger Woods in difficulties and leave their record, up to that point, in four points.
The European team, captained by Thomas Bjorn, who was looking to retain the trophy won by the American team last year, dominated the fourballs of the morning and took a 3-1 lead.
The United States played the first two days at the Royal Troon Golf Club, but were beaten by a score of 3½ to 2½.
The team of Jim Furyk needed to win eight of the 12 singles matches on Sunday to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European player to achieve four consecutive points, while Molinari, known as Molliwood after a successful weekend, are only the second pair to win four points in their first four matches in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they had a brilliant display to beat Dechambeau and Woods by a 5&4 score.
Woods, who had been struggling in two rounds, showed signs of brilliance, but has lost 19 of 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who did not play in the morning fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the afternoon singles and lost 2 to 1 to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who were ranked as the top two players in the world.
The weather was fine and the weather was fine and the weather was fine and the weather was fine and the weather was fine and the weather was fine and the weather was fine and the weather was fine and the weather was fine and the weather was fine and the weather was fine and the weather was fine and the weather was fine and the weather was fine and the weather was fine and the weather was fine and the weather was fine and the weather was fine and the weather was fine and the weather was fine and the weather was fine and the weather was fine and the weather was fine and the weather was fine and the weather was fine and the weather was fine and the weather was fine and the weather was fine and the weather was fine and the weather was fine and the weather was fine and the weather was fine and the weather was fine and the weather was fine and the weather was fine and the weather was fine and the weather was fine and the weather was fine and the weather was fine and the weather was fine and the weather was fine and the weather was
Jordan Spieth, three times champion of the Masters Tournament, and Justin Thomas set a new standard for Americans by finishing in a tie for second place.
They achieved a victory with determination by 2 to 1 against the Spaniard Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and, later, won Poulter and Rory McIlroy by 4 to 3 in the foursomes, after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup had a team come back from a deficit of four points in the singles, although the Furyk team needs to draw to retain the trophy.
The Turkish government has been trying to keep the peace in the region, but the situation is still unclear.
North Korea declares it will not disarm unilaterally 'nothing at all' if there is no sign of trust
The North Korean Foreign Minister told the UN Security Council that the sanctions were intensifying North Korea's distrust of the United States and that, in such circumstances, the country would not unilaterally eliminate its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho said at the UN General Assembly annual meeting that North Korea had taken «measures of good will» during the previous year, such as stopping nuclear tests and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear testing facility and pledging to not proliferate nuclear weapons.
We have noticed that the United States has not responded to our request for a meeting with the Turkish ambassador.
«We have no confidence in the United States, and there is no trust in our national security and, in these circumstances, we will not initiate unilateral disarmament of any kind.»
If Ri had taken the North Korean complaints about the resistance of Washington to a'stage-by-stage' approach to nuclear disarmament, it would have been significant for him to reject unilateral nuclear disarmament, as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri made reference to the joint declaration that they made at the first North Korea-United States summit in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim Jong Un pledged to work on the "de-nuclearisation of the Korean peninsula", while Trump pledged to provide North Korea with guarantees for its security.
North Korea has tried to put an end to the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States have communicated that before Pyongyang can be disarmed, it must first destroy its nuclear weapons.
Washington also has resisted the call to tighten sanctions on North Korea.
The US insist that first the nuclear weapons must be disarmed and increase the pressure on Iran to achieve their goal of coercively achieving their goal of nuclear disarmament, and oppose the «declaration of war» declaration,
The perception that the sanctions will make us kneel is a myth of those who don't know us.
But the problem is that the sanctions are continually intensifying our distrust.
The president of the United States, Donald Trump, said he would not be surprised if he met with Kim Jong-un in the future.
Instead, the minister emphasized three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: «If the involved part in the nuclear disarmament issue was South Korea instead of the US, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula would not have reached this stalemate».
The speech of Ri was very different from that of the year before, when he declared that North Korea's nuclear weapons program was inevitable after Mr. Evil Trump called North Korea a «rocket man» in a suicide mission.
The United Nations, Trump, who the year before threatened to destroy North Korea completely, praised Kim for his courage to take such a course, but he said that much more work is needed to ensure that North Korea is fully disarmed and the sanctions are maintained until North Korea is fully desnuclearized.
The president of the United States, Donald Trump, has said that he does not have a time frame for the withdrawal of American troops from Syria.
The Chinese and Russian ambassadors to the UN say the UN should reward North Korea for its nuclear test.
However, the secretary of state of the United States, Mike Pompeo, declared at the UN Security Council that: «The application of UN Security Council sanctions must continue energetically and without exception until we confirm nuclear disarmament is complete and definitive».
The Security Council has unanimously adopted a resolution imposing economic sanctions on North Korea for its continued missile and nuclear testing programme.
Pompeo met with Ri in the UN General Assembly and then visited Pyongyang the following month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his latest trip was not a success.
He left Pyongyang on July 27, saying he had made significant progress, but hours later North Korea accused him of making demands of a gangster.
In a meeting with Moon, North Korea committed to dismantling a nuclear weapons facility and a missile base if the United States took any kind of countermeasures.
He said that Kim had told him that the measures in accordance with which he sought security were the security measures that Trump had promised in Singapore, and actions toward normalizing relations with Washington.
The students of Harvard take a course on habits of rest
The Harvard University has a new year of students, who have been allowed to sleep more, in an attempt to combat the culture of studying during the night, stimulated by caffeine.
A scholar observed that students at the number one university in the world are often confused about the basics of caring for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of Medicine of the Sleep at Harvard Medical School and specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
I was inspired to create the course after giving a talk about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“Why are you telling me all this now, in my last year?”
He said he had never heard of the importance of sleep, which is why I was surprised when I was told of its importance.
The course, implemented for the first time this year, covers the basics of good sleep habits and improves academic and sport performance, as well as general well-being.
The Harvard Medical School has introduced a course in Turkish sleep disorders, the first of its kind in the world.
The course, of one hour in length, includes a series of tasks.
In a section there is a bedroom, where students have to click on a coffee cup, curtains, shoes, and books to receive information about the effects of caffeine and light, on how it affects sport performance, and on the importance of keeping a routine to go to sleep.
The sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, depression, and cancer.
The following map shows the campus with icons that animate the participants to think about their daily routine.
We know that the students' conduct will not change immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know, as one has the right to know the effects that smoking tobacco has on health.
The Turkish people are proud of their ability to keep themselves awake all night long, and the technology of modern life and the pressure of the pressures on students make it a growing problem.
Students should ensure a good quality sleep during enough time to be a secret weapon against stress, boredom, fatigue and anxiety, he said, even to avoid gaining weight, as it puts the brain into a mode of inanity and makes students hungry.
Raymond So, a California-born 19-year-old student of chemistry and physics, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, after having attended one of his classes the last year during his first year at Harvard.
Raymond said he had opened his eyes and inspired him to promote the course in all the campus.
The next step, according to him, is to ask graduate students to undertake a programme of studies similar before they join the institution.
The professor Czeisler recommended students to take note of the fact that they should put an alarm on when they go to bed and when they awake, and be aware of the harmful effects of blue light from electronic devices and LED lights, which can disturb the rhythm of the circadian rhythm and cause problems with sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: The goal by Menga knocks Liverpool out of the race
The goal by Dolly Menga condemns the disbanded Steven Gerrard's team to a 1-0 defeat at home to Livingston.
The Ibrox club was looking to extend its unbeaten run at home to three games, but the visitors were the ones who inflicted the second defeat on Gary Holt in 18 games as manager, leaving the Hearts top of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga scored the first goal, and it looked as if the Rangers, lacking inspiration, were about to equalise the score.
While the Rangers now fall to sixth place, the Livingston climb to third place, behind the Hibernian by goal difference.
The Rangers could face more difficulties after, as they could be faced with more difficulties after, as the line judge Calum Spence required medical attention after a head injury sustained from an object that appeared to be thrown from the crowd.
Gerrard made eight changes from the side that beat Ayr in the semi-final of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, put the same eleven that started a point against the Hearts last week.
The Rangers dominated possession, but the Livingston created more danger when they had the ball.
De fet, haurien d'haver marcat als dos minuts de partit, quan la primera intervenció de Menga va deixar sol a Scot Pittman davant d'Allan McGregor, però el migcampista va xutar desviat i va desaprofitar la gran ocasió.
A free kick by Keaghan Jacobs struck the post and Alan Lithgow's shot was saved by the post.
The Rangers took control, but they seemed to have more faith in their game in the final quarter.
Alfredo Morelos believed that he should have had a penalty at the fifteen minute mark, as he and Steven Lawless collided, but referee Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian's complaints.
The Rangers only made two shots on target in the first half, but the first goalkeeper of the Ibrox, Liam Kelly, had no problem with the headed goal from Lassana Coulibaly and the easy strike from Ovie Ejaria.
The first act of the Livi the Minutes 34 is a good one, but it is not a great one.
The Rangers could not stop the play.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept calm and scored a simple goal.
Gerrard made a change at half time, replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent. The change had an immediate impact, as Morelos crossed the ball to Moreira, who ran into Kelly.
Their next stop was in the town of Ladik, where they were greeted by a large crowd.
The band of Holt could have ceded control of the ship to the staunchest of the captains, but McGregor stuck with Lithgow before he made a bad shot from the corner.
The replacement for the Rangers Glenn Middleton still asked for a penalty for a dispute with Jacobs, but again Thomson made the eyes wide open.
The almanac is the instrument that measures the time.
The territory of Turkey is more than 1,600 kilometres (1,000 mi) long and 800 km (500 mi) wide, with a roughly rectangular shape.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, a device that eventually led to the invention of the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter, which is a pillar of science since then, also became a pop culture icon, as in the 1950 movie "Bells of Coronado", starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, a pair of cowboys who are physically and mentally disabled but are actually geniuses:
What is this thing?
It is a Geiger counter, which is used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on these earphones, you can hear the effects of the atoms that emanation from the radioactive minerals.
Evans: "I think it's about to blow!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days after his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name continues to live.
A new cancer vaccine may teach the immune system to “see” cancer cells.
A new cancer vaccine may teach the immune system to “see” and destroy cancer cells.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of the treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient and altering them in the lab
You can “see” a common protein in many cancers, and then reinject them.
A vaccine trial is showing promising results in patients with various types of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who taught the immune system to recognize malignant cells, saw the cancer disappear after 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, altering them in the lab to allow the patient to see a protein present in many types of cancer (HER2) and, subsequently, returning to inject them.
According to the professor Jay Berzofsky, of the National Cancer Institute of Bethesda, Maryland (United States): "We have a promising vaccine candidate."
The HER2 protein “favors the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal, has explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to extracting immune cells from patients and teaching them to treat cancer cells has worked in treating a type of leukemia.
Kanye West got into a heated argument with SNL host Seth Meyers after his performance on the show.
The war ended in defeat for the Ottoman Empire.
Kanye West was heckled by host Jimmy Fallon during a live performance on Saturday Night Live after a chaotic performance in which he praised President Donald Trump and said he would run for president in 2020.
After his third song of the night, titled Ghost Town, in which he wore a hat with the phrase Make America Great Again, he began to criticize Democrats and to reiterate his support for Trump.
"I always talk to white people and they say: How can you like Trump if he is racist?
I would have left the United States a long time ago, if I was concerned about racism.

The Turkish government has been accused of trying to silence the voice of the Armenian genocide denier Denis Robert.
The Turkish government has been accused of trying to undermine the credibility of the United States.
I have been told that the Turkish government has been very kind to me.
"They threatened me behind the scenes.
I told him to put on his hat.
They besieged me.
I then say I am in a lower position" said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West said: "I want to see the position below.
Try to imagine a rectangle with a side length of 1,600 kilometres (1,000 mi) and a width of 800 kilometres (500 mi).
His comments provoked the heckling of the audience at least twice and the members of the show seemed embarrassed, according to Variety, which had a reporter on set who explained to the publication: "The entire studio was completely mute."
West was chosen as a replacement for last minute replacement Ariana Grande, who had recently died.
West left the audience stunned by his rendition of the song I Love it, disguised as a bottle of Perrier.
West got the backing of the conservative leader of the TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "Thank you for the spirit: THIS IS A THREADY!"
But the host of the show, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West was "being who he is and that he is absolutely wonderful."
But I have chosen not to reward someone (selling his music or clothing or supporting his "art") who I believe adopts and spreads a political ideology that harms my community.
He is free.
I too, my dear, I too.
Before the show, rapper Kanye West announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and was now known as "the being before known as Kanye West".
No one has done it before, but there are a few who have followed in his footsteps.
His colleague rapper, Snoop Dogg, was once called Snoop Lion and the legendary musician Prince changed his name to a symbol and, subsequently, the artist known previously as Prince.
Accusation of murder in a restaurant in Belfast

The prosecutor will review the charges.
The star of Game of Thrones, Kit Harington, accuses a toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for playing the role of the swordsman Jon Snow in the fantasy drama series Game of Thrones.
This is not a role that I would choose to play.
In an interview with Culture magazine, Kit said he believed something had gone wrong and was questioning how to tackle the issue of toxic masculinity in the age of #MeToo.
Kit, who recently got married with the star of Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31, has admitted feeling a bit of determination to tackle this problem.
“I wonder where we went wrong with our masculinity.
“What have we taught men during their development in relation to the problem we are now facing?”
The media can have a part of responsibility for the rise of toxic masculinity through their characters.
What is innate and what is acquired?
What is taught on television and in the streets that makes young men feel that they have to be virile?
I think it is one of the great questions of our time: how do we change it?
Because certainly something has been done wrong with the young people.
I don’t think I’ll do any prequels or sequels.
About November, Kit will star in a re-shoot of Sam Shepard’s True West, which tells the story of a filmmaker and his brother, who is a thief.
I’ve met Rose Leslie, who plays Daenerys Targaryen on Game of Thrones.
I met my wife on the show, so I gave her my future family and my life in the future.
Rose was the role of Ygritte, Jon Snow’s love interest, in the fantasy drama series that won an Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 in Scotland.
China reports a 14% increase in HIV/AIDS cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820,000 people affected in the country, according to the health authorities.
Only in the second quarter of 2018, 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of new cases are sexually transmitted infections, unlike the situation in the past, when most cases were due to infection from food poisoning.
The traditional method of transmission of HIV in China was through blood transfusions.
This is not to say that the number of people who contracted HIV from this cause has been reduced to zero, as the Chinese health officials have said in a conference in the province of Yunnan.
Any after any, but, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased 100,000 people.
The transmission of HIV/AIDS is a serious problem for the LGBT community in China.
The homosexuality law in China was passed in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community is common.
The conservative estimates suggest that between 70 and 90% of homosexual men who maintain relationships with men will eventually marry a woman.
Many of the diseases transmitted by sexual intercourse are due to the lack of precautions taken in the relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged to make anti-HIV medication available to all HIV-positive patients.
Maxine Waters denies that a staffer has leaked information to the Republican Party and unravels “falsehoods” and “dangerous theories”
The representative of the United States Maxine Waters denounced the allegations that a member of her staff had leaked personal information of three Republican senators to the Wikipedia pages of those senators.
The Democratic Party of California has been accused of being a 'hate group' and of being 'anti-Muslim'.

The supposed information contained the addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, and Mike Lee, of Utah.
The information appeared online Thursday and was published by an unknown person in the Senate's Committee on the Judiciary during a session on the allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The senators were concerned that Kavanaugh's nomination would give the president too much power over the judiciary.
The conservative media outlets, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the publications was related to Waters' office and that it revealed the personal information of a member of Waters' staff.

The member of my personal staff, my personal data, my personal security, and my personal privacy, has been compromised by these false and fraudulent allegations and the leak of this information.
This is a complete fabrication.
The Turkish Foreign Ministry's reaction to the U.S. Secretary of State's comments on the Turkish-American relationship was swift and negative.
This denial is full of indignation.
"That makes him a good candidate for Congress."
When someone is accused of a crime that he did not commit, he should not be angry.
Don't be too confident.
The accuser does not question the motives of the accused.
He must keep calm and bear his suffering.
The Republican Party is a party of the people, not of the elites.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who ran for the seat of the late Senator Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"This is important if it is true", twitted.
The Turkish government has been informed of the situation and is investigating the matter.
"We will secure the disclosure of the criminals, and that they will be made to bear legal responsibility for all actions that they have carried out and that they have harmed all and each of the members of my staff."
The latest Johnny English parody, starring Rowan Atkinson as the title character, is a smart, funny, and hilarious take on the James Bond movies.
Ja és tradició cercar referències al Brexit en qualsevol nova pel·lícula amb un enfocament britànic, i aquesta reposició de la franquícia de la paròdia d'acció-comèdia de Johnny English, que va néixer el 2003 amb Johnny English i va tornar a aparèixer el 2011 amb Johnny English Reborn, no n”és una excepció.
This is a funny satire on how we are as less than human beings.
In any case, the incompetent of eyes sorted and cheeky face Johnny English has been able to renew his licence to twist everything. His name indicates more than any other thing that is a comic creation designed for territories of non-English speaking countries with a long history of going to the cinema.
Obviously, it's the stupid agent secret who, despite his silly pretensions of glamour, has a little bit of Clouseau, a bit of Mr. Bean and a bit of this guy who brings a note to the theme of Carros de foc at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
The original concept was based on the mysterious traveller from the TV advertisements for Barclaycard, who was going berserk in the streets of Istanbul.
There are two good moments in this last journey of JE.
I loved the Johnny English who approached a helicopter dressed in a medieval armour and the blades of the rotor beating on his helmet.
S”hi veu el do que té Atkinson per a la comèdia física, però l’humor sembla bastant fluix i estranyament superflu, especialment perquè marques cinematogràfiques "serioses" com 007 i Missió Impossible ara ja inclouen la comèdia com a ingredient.
The humour seems aimed at children rather than adults and, for me, the absurd adventures of Johnny English are not as funny as Mr. Bean’s Mr. Bean sketches that Atkinson does.
The British Empire is in trouble.
A pirate computer has infiltrated the British spy network and revealed the identities of all the agents on the ground, which provokes the consternation of the agent of service, a small part for a sadly small role.
It’s the last resort for a first minister who is a pretence and being besieged, who is now suffering from a total collapse of political popularity: Emma Thompson delivers the best of herself as this calcated version of Theresa May, but the script doesn’t quite reach more.
Their intelligence advisers tell you that, as you become more dangerous, you will have to recover some of your spies who are retired.
I includes the silly Johnny English, now employed as a teacher in some high-end institution, but still teaching classes extra-officially on how to be an agent, with some good gags, like when English offers a spy school that looks like a rock ’n’ roll school.
English is returned quickly to Whitehall for an emergency meeting with his patient sequaç Bough, who is played by Ben Miller.
Now Bough is a married man, tied to a submarine, a role which is a little underused, but Vicki Pepperdine is a little underused.
The Batman and Robin of when the things get very bad at the service of His Majesty’s Secret Service find in Olga Kurylenko the spectacular “femme fatale” Ophelia Bulletova.
While the first minister falls under the enchantment of the charming computer entrepreneur who claims to be able to solve the computer problems of Britain: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their bizarre adventures: disguised as French chefs, they set fire to a French restaurant, make a contraband on board the yacht of luxury, and cause a great confusion by using a virtual reality headset to familiarise themselves with the interior of Volta’s house.
All the stops are certainly from this last sequence, but with the simplicity and noise of a children’s programme, it seems a children’s programme.
The things that are quite normal.
The film is a funny, fast-paced, and very funny film.
The Labour Party denies that it is plotting to reduce the working week to four days
The Labour Party will have to consider a radical plan according to which British workers will work four days a week and will be paid five.
The party wants to give employees a day off to celebrate the day they won’t be working.
The employees would enjoy three days’ leave, but would receive the same salary.
According to the sources, the idea would fit the economic agenda of the parties and the plans to shift the country in favor of workers.
The four-day week is supported by the Turkish Trade Union Congress as a method for workers to benefit from the economic change.
A source close to the Labour Party said: “It is expected that a review of the policy will be announced before the end of the year.
It is not a matter of the night to day, but a week of four days is a fitting perspective for the economic perspective of the party and in the strategic industrial policy of the party.
The Labour Party has not been the first to support this idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day week during the 2017 general election campaign.
The Labour Party does not support the Kurdish issue.
According to a Labour Party spokesman: “A weekend of four days is not a party policy and the party is not considering it.”
The Labour Party's shadow finance minister John McDonnell said the party's economic policy would be based on the principles of socialism.
McDonnell was determined to restore the power of the "anonymous directors" and "speculators" in public utilities.
The plans of the shadow minister also include that the shareholders of the water companies could not recover all their investment, as the government laborist could apply deductions for the crimes that it sees.
The company also plans to place workers on the boards of firms and create a 10% shareholder fund to distribute dividends to employees, who expect to receive annual dividends of up to 500 GBP.
The United States is a country in the Middle East.
The FBI's investigation of Judge Brett Kavanaugh's allegations has delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court at least a week, and has raised the question of whether a Republican senator might withdraw his support.
In an interview to be broadcast Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asks Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could uncover anything that makes them change their minds.
The United States is a country in the Middle East.
"I'm seriously talking to you", said Kennedy.
I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when the scandal broke and the allegations were made public, and asked him if he had done it.
He was firm, determined and confident."
The territory of Turkey is more than 1,600 kilometres (1,000 mi) long and 800 km (500 mi) wide, with a roughly rectangular shape.
I have my opinion on Brett Kavanaugh and I would present a bombing charge.
"Dra. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it rotundly.
I am not aware of anyone who can verify it.
He has 36 years.
I don't see any change coming up."
What is the Global Citizen Festival? What has it done to reduce poverty?
New York City will host this year’s Global Citizen Festival, a yearly event that brings together some of the world’s most talented artists to raise awareness and funds for the fight against poverty.
In its seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people gather at the Great Lawn of Central Park to enjoy performances by Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to awake the global consciousness of the event's goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international non-governmental organization that aims to end poverty by encouraging people to help others.
To receive a free ticket for the event (unless someone wanted to pay a VIP ticket), the attendees had to do a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a call, or any other activity to awaken consciousness about the goal of ending poverty.
What successes has achieved Global Citizen so far and what success will it achieve in the next 12 years?
The idea of giving away a free concert is a good way to persuade people to demand action or just a case of "clicktivism" (people who think they can make a difference by signing a petition on line or sending a tweet?
The number of people who have signed up to the campaign has grown to over 19 million.
The United Nations has committed to a total of 37,000 million USD in development assistance to help countries achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.
The group has made over 390 commitments and announcements, of which at least 10,000 million USD have been raised or pledged.
The group estimates that the protected areas have had a direct impact on more than 649 million people around the world.
Some of the major commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based investor and realizer commitment with its own fundraising campaign, which is committed to helping children grow as much as possible and to fighting malnutrition in Rwanda after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"Thanks to the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and members of Global Citizens, we can turn the injustice of malnutrition into a footnote in history", said the ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, in a live broadcast from London in April 2018.
The group also explained that after more than 5,000 actions that asked the UK government to improve nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced the financing of a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
I don't know why we should be concerned about poverty.
The road to the top of the world is long and difficult.
But we will win, because together we are stronger.”
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are some of the artists who will perform at the event this year, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy as a "blocking" to obstruct Russian energy exports (Secretary of the Interior)
Washington can, "if necessary", call on the Navy to stop Russian energy from hitting markets, including the Middle East, and the markets of the East, including the Middle East,
The Russian intervention in Syria, particularly, where it operates with invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I think the reason for them being in the Middle East is their will to negotiate with energy, like they do in the Eastern European countries,” he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to confront this issue.
"The United States has the capacity, along with the Navy, to guarantee that the seaways are open and, if necessary, to blockade the market, to prevent their energy from entering the market".
Zinke spoke to Consumer Energy Alliance's audience at the Energy Efficiency Summit, a conference for the energy industry.
He compared the Washington strategy for negotiating with Russia and Iran, and pointed out that it is the same.
“The economic option in Iran and Russia is to replace and substitute fossil fuels”, said, while indicating that Russia has only one resource, which is the fossil fuels.
The Turkish government has been trying to attract foreign investment to the country's energy sector, which is dominated by the state-owned Eni.
With this end in mind, the U.S. administration Trump, including the President of the United States, Donald Trump, have tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the North Stream 2 "unsatisfactory" gas pipeline, which according to Trump, made Berlin a "captive" of Moscow.
Moscow has consistently repeated that the gas pipeline project Nord Stream 2, which has cost $11 billion and will double the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110,000 million cubic meters, is purely economic.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's opposition is simply economic reasons and is an example of trade competition.
I believe that energy should not be used as a tool to pressure consumers, and consumers should have the option to choose their suppliers, said the Russian energy minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with the secretary of the US Department of Energy Rick Perry, held in Moscow last September.
The German government has rejected the US proposal to join the NATO-led intervention in Syria.
The German industrial association, FDI, has called on the US to withdraw from the EU energy deal and to pursue bilateral agreements with Russia.
I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, director of BDI (Federal Association of German Industry).
The senator from Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren will “think deeply” whether she will run for president in 2020.
The senator from Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren would consider her candidacy for the presidency after the midterm elections.
The meeting was held in Holyoke, Massachusetts, on the evening of the first Monday in April, and was attended by about a hundred people.
It is time for women to go to Washington and fix the fracture of the government, and women should occupy high government offices.
“After the 6 November, I will take my presidential campaign seriously.
Warren intervened on the President Donald Trump during the municipal meeting and said he was "bringing the country in the wrong direction".
I am very concerned about the threat to democracy that President Trump is making.
Warren has been frank in his criticism of Trump and his nominee for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.

The poll also showed that a majority of Warren's own voters believed he should not run for president in 2020.
About half of Massachusetts' likely voters say that Senator Clinton should not run, according to an opinion poll by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
About one third of the population of Turkey would support the candidacy.
The poll showed a narrow support for the candidate Deval Patrick, with 38 percent in favor and 48 percent against.
Other high-profile Democrats who were considered for the 2020 presidential nomination include Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders.
The Turkish government has been trying to keep the peace with the Kurds, but the Kurds are not going to be silent.

"With what's happening to my own son, I can understand other families who suffer from posttraumatic stress disorder and some of the emotional wounds that return our soldiers.
The elephant in the room is a reference to the fact that the Turkish government has kept the true extent of the war in the country from the public eye.
The arrested man was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and is charged with domestic violence against a woman, with a statement for domestic violence and possession of a firearm under the influence of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, Wasilla Police Department spokesman.
18 states and DC support challenge to new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the challenge to a new US policy that denies asylum to victims of domestic violence or other crimes.
Representatives of 18 states and the district filed an amicus brief to support a refugee who challenged the Trump administration's immigration policy, according to NBC News.
The case was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California on August 19, 2014.
She said that her partner "and the children of the member of the violent gang" assaulted her, but the U.S. immigration officials denied her asylum request on 20 July.
The Turkish government has been trying to stop the flow of migrants from the Middle East to the United States.
The lawyers of the states that support Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where a large number of asylum seekers arrive from the United States, as countries that face problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new immigration policy of the United States revoked a 2014 decision of the Immigration Appeals Board, which allowed undocumented immigrants to flee domestic violence for asylum.
The new policy ignores decades of state, federal and international law.
The laws of the federal government require that asylum claims be adjudicated according to the facts and circumstances of the particular case, and this violation of the principle of non-refoulement infringes that principle.
The law also harms the economy of the United States, as it is more likely that immigrants will become entrepreneurs and provide needed jobs.
The United States Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to deny asylum to victims of domestic violence and gang-related crimes.
"Asylum is available for those who leave their country for persecution or fear of persecution on the basis of race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social or political group", Sessions said in an 11 June announcement.
The asylum has never been designed to alleviate all the problems, nor even the most serious, that people face every day elsewhere in the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as casualties mount, as the death toll rises to more than 200
The situation is getting worse.
"The environment is very tense", said the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma while calming her son with fever in a shelter in the devastated city of Palu.
"Each minute, a stretcher brings bodies.
There is no water.
The residents have returned to their homes to find their belongings destroyed by floodwaters and try to salvage whatever they can.
There are hundreds of injured, and hospitals are overwhelmed by the earthquake.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who has fractured his shoulder, are being treated outside the military hospital in Palu, as the patients are being treated outside because of the strong shaking that is happening.
The tears blinded his eyes as he described how the violent earthquake shook the fifth floor of the hotel where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
“No time to save us.”
I was trapped in the ruins of the wall, I think, he said, and my family had been at a wedding.

I hope you're well.
The United States Ambassador to Turkey accuses China of "aggressive" propaganda.
A week after a Chinese official newspaper published an advertisement in a U.S. daily promoting the advantages of trade between the U.S. and China, the U.S. ambassador to China has accused Beijing of using the press in the U.S. to disseminate propaganda.
President Donald Trump spoke to the Chinese Daily's payment section in the Des Moines Register, the state's largest daily newspaper, after accusing China of interfering in the upcoming midterm elections.
The accusation by President Donald Trump that Beijing was trying to interfere in the US elections was a new phase of the Washington campaign to intensify pressure on China.
Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a trade war that is intensifying and has seen increasingly high trade tariffs on imports from each other.
The Chinese retaliation tariffs on imports from Iowa and other states were aimed at punishing the Trump administration’s trade rivals, according to experts in China and the United States.
Terry Branstad, the former Ambassador of the United States to China and former Governor of Iowa, a longtime exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion piece in The Des Moines Register Sunday: "China is redoubling its harassment with the publication of propaganda ads in our free papers."
The Chinese government uses the American tradition of free speech and free press to disseminate its propaganda, using the paid advertisement in The Des Moines Register.
"But in Beijing, at the corner of the street, there is no reflection of the disparate opinions of the Chinese people on the country's economic trajectory, as the media are dominated by the Communist Party of China."
The Chinese daily "Global Times" has declined to publish an article by a Turkish writer, who was invited to write about the Turkish-Chinese relations.
The Republican Party has been in a state of confusion over the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
As many of the most prominent Republican supporters of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh support and defend him, many of the same Republicans who support and defend Kavanaugh will be opposed to the election results.
The emotions surrounding this case are extremely high and most of the Republican voters already show officially that they want to make a step forward.
These things can't be unraveled", said Professor Reeher, a political science professor at Maxwell School of Syracuse University, in an article that was published on Sunday.
Reeher said that Flake’s pressure to investigate the FBI’s role in the investigation of the Turkish ambassador to the United States is not enough to calm voters angry at the investigation.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, nor tomorrow, nor in November", said Karine Jean-Pierre, the principal and national spokesperson for the progressive MoveOn, Friday, according to the Washington Post
Friday morning, protesters shouted "november is coming!" (novembre s’acosta) while protesting in the Senate lobby while the Republicans on the Judiciary Committee continued to hold hearings on the nomination of Kavanaugh despite the testimony of Christine Blasey Ford, according to the Mic.
The Turkish people are very passionate about their country and the government.
"The people say they've been high; it is true.
But the Turkish government has been able to maintain a high level of political stability, and the economy has grown rapidly.
Even before the public testimony of Ford, which detailed his alleged rape of a woman, the analysts suggested that the Republicans could refuse confirmation if they pressed for it.
"This is a mess," said former GOP National Committee president Michael Steele, according to NBC News.
"It’s not just about the vote on the court or the final vote, it’s also about how the Republicans have handled this and how they have treated her. It’s also about how the Republicans have handled this and how they have treated her", said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, on CNN.
However, Americans seem to be divided between those who believe in the Ford's Star and those who believe in Kavanaugh's testimony, with the balance leaning slightly towards the latter.
A new poll shows that 41 per cent of those polled believe Ford's testimony to be unambiguously or probably true, while 35 per cent say they believe Kavanaugh's testimony to be unambiguously or probably true.
A further 38 per cent of respondents believed that Kavanaugh had lied, while a further 30 per cent believed he had said something likely or undeniably.
After the pressure of Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the demands made by Ford and, at least, of another plaintiff, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judicial Committee under oath that Kavanaugh had assaulted him under the influence of alcohol when he was 17 years old.
Ramírez accuses Supreme Court nominee of groping her genitals in a party while they were studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the web, is launching a new company that is competing with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the legend of technology, Inrupt, is a company that is based on the open-source Solid platform.
The platform Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and who can access that information.
In a recent interview with Fast Company, Sir Tim Berners-Lee joked that the intention of Inrupt was to "dominate the world".
"We have to do it now", said the newly formed company.
It's a historic moment.
The application uses the Solid platform to allow users to create their own "online personal data warehouse" or a Personal Data Warehouse (PDW).
It can contain contact lists, tasks, a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like the Google Drive, the Microsoft Outlook, the Slack and the Spotify. They all are available at once.
The data warehouse is a personal store of information that is only available to the user.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data".
The idea behind Inrupt, according to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, is to integrate resources, processes and skills so that the Solid platform is available to everyone.
The company is currently led by Tim Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, some internal developers hired by the company and a community of volunteer coders.
A week from now, developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that nobody from his team is talking to Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a radical change to all business models at once.
"We're not asking permission."
Inrupt’s mission is to provide commercial power and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web integrated into the Solid platform.
The World Wide Web Consortium was founded in 1994 by Tim Berners-Lee, who is also the inventor of the World Wide Web.
The Internet is a global network of computers that connects people around the world.
Even after the launch of Inrupt, I will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about the new era of the web".
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the Victoria Cross of the First World War
The only Church of England clergyman to win a Victoria Cross during the First World War was awarded the award while serving as a combat medic in France.
The award of the Distinguished Service Cross was made by the President of the United States of America, on the recommendation of the Commander-in-Chief, American Expeditionary Force, General John J. Pershing, on the recommendation of the Commander-in-Chief, American Expeditionary Force, General John J.

Pershing, on the recommendation of the Commander-in-Chief, American Expeditionary Force, General John J. Pershing, on the recommendation
It was not until four days later that he learned that he had won the British military's highest award, the Victoria Cross.
The ceremony was attended by the British Ambassador to Turkey, Sir Andrew McNaughton, and the British Consul General, Mr. David Hodgson.
It is a magnificently symbolic moment for us to present this plaque to the memory of the late Captain Robert E. Peary, who was the first to reach the North Pole.
According to The London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, the lieutenant colonel Vann led his battalion through a foggy and stiffening "cloud" and under the "constant and accurate" fire of "cannons and machine-guns".
He then ran towards the firing line and, with the most courageous bravery, he advanced the front of a column before launching himself on a cannon with one hand and leaving astonished three members of the detachment.
The German commander was killed by a sniper on 4 October 1918, just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann (72) said his grandfather’s actions were a feat that he could never match, which gives you a sense of humility.
The two brothers, the dr. James Vann and his brother, the dr. John Vann, also left a crown after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was very honour to be part of the parade and added that the true heroes are the people who support them.
The fans of MMA who stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, watched the Peppa Pig instead
Imagine you stay awake all night to see Bellator 206 and you’re denied seeing the most important event.
The San Jose Cartel contained 13 fights, including six of the card's main event fights, and were to be shown live in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6:00, when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were about to fight, the programme changed to Peppa Pig.
Some people were displeased to have been kept awake all night to see the fight.
A cartoonist on Twitter has made a cartoon of Turkey’s new map.
The government's content policy says that at 6:00 this content is not appropriate, so they changed to children's programming.
"Peppa the pig, that's my name."
The company Bellator is looking to add the UK to its list of countries where it broadcasts its events.
"I think repetition works, but it's not easy to do it well", said Coker.
But we are in the morning of a Sunday and we can’t solve it until Sunday at our time, Monday at theirs.
We're working on it.
I believe you, when I changed channels, there were many messages that went and came, and not all were pleasant.
We tried to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it was a government problem.
I promise you that I won't do it again.
We'll leave it in five fights, rather than six as we normally do. We'll try to show it to the fans, but it wasn't done.
It is a sad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley was ‘incredibly’ embarrassed about his sexuality
The Olympic champion Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to the rest of the world because of his sexuality, but that it gave him the motivation to succeed.
The athlete of 24 years has said he didn’t realize until he went to high school that there wasn’t everyone like him.
I’m a big fan of the BBC Radio 4 programme, Desert Island Discs.
He also said that being a father had taken away some of the importance of winning the Olympics.
The presenter of the long-running programme, Kirsty Young, has taken a break from the show to undergo treatment for breast cancer.
Daley, who appeared as a castaway on the first show of Laverne, said he felt "less than" the other kids because "it wasn't acceptable socially for boys and girls to be like that."
He said the following: "I have said the following: "To this day, those feelings of inferiority and difference, have been things that I have truly experienced and that have given me the power and the strength to succeed".
I wanted to prove that it was something, he said, to not disappoint anyone when it was discovered that he was gay.
The two-time Olympic medalist has become a high-profile advocate for the LGBT movement and has used his image at the Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said he had spoken because he was lucky to live openly without branches and wanted to give “hope” to others.
The three-time world champion has fallen in love with a man, Dustin Lance Black, who he met in 2013, "I was surprised".
The couple met in the early 1990s when Daley was a member of the crew of the film "The Last Emperor".
I think when you get older, you get a lot of experience. You can find someone who has experienced similar highs and lows.
The couple were parents to a baby boy in June, who they named Robert Ray Black-Daley.
"If you had asked me a year ago, I would have said I needed to win an Olympic gold medal.
There are things more important than the Olympic medals.
My Olympic gold medal is the Robbie.
His son is called like his father, Robert, who died in 2011, at the age of 40, from a brain tumor.
According to Daley, his father did not accept that he had to die and one of the last things he asked was if they had already got the London 2012 tickets because he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t say to him, ‘Dad, you won’t be in the front row,’ he said.
"While holding his hand, he stopped breathing and did not breathe for the first time in a long time, and finally I accepted that he was not invincible."
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Summer Olympics and won bronze.
"I knew that this was the dream I had been dreaming of: jumping in front of a crowd at home in the Olympics. No feeling better."
I also inspired the choice of my first song (Proud), which I had heard during the preparation for the Olympic Games and that still made me shiver.
Desert Island Discs is a BBC Radio 4 programme about music.

The American Phil Mickelson will break the record for most Ryder Cup appearances when he plays in Sunday’s final singles.
Mickelson, who will be participating in the biennial event for the 12th time, was presented by captain Jim Furyk for the “fourballs” and “fouromes” matches on Saturday.
In place of being in the centre of the action, as has been the case for the United States, the winner of five major tournaments has spent his time between being an animator and working on his game on the course, hoping to correct the mistakes that hurt him.
He has never made the most direct drivers, and even at his best, he hasn’t been the ideal choice for the difficult trajectory at Le Golf National, where the long rough tends to punish misses.
I si la seva pròpia trajectòria no és prou descoratjadora, Mickelson, al novè partit diumenge, s’enfrontarà el precís campió de l’Open Britànic, Francesco Molinari, que s’ha unit al rookie Tommy Fleetwood per guanyar els quatre partits d’aquesta setmana.
If the Americans start strong, the match could be a close affair.
I have a lot of respect for him. He's a great player.
"He understood perfectly my role for that day, he gave me a palmada on the back and surrounded me with his arm, saying that he would be ready the next day", said Furyk.
He has a lot of confidence in himself.
It is a hall of fame and has given a lot to these teams previously and this week.
Probably, I didn't imagine him playing two matches.
I thought I would have more, but that’s how I trained and that’s how we believed we were going to advance.
He wants to be there, like any other.
Mickelson will surpass the record of Nick Faldo of the most Ryder Cup matches played.
It may be the end of a career in the Ryder Cup that does not equal the individual record.
Mickelson has won 18 times, 20 losses, and 7 ties, but Furyk has said that his presence has added intangibles to the team.
“He is a funny, sarcastic, jovial, and a great team player.
“I think the younger players also enjoyed mocking him this week, which was fun to see.
The territory of Turkey is more than 1,600 kilometres (1,000 mi) long and 800 km (500 mi) wide, with a roughly rectangular shape.
The captain of the European team, Thomas Bjorn, knows that the advantage can be lost soon.
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows by experience that starting with a large lead in the final singles matches of the Ryder Cup can quickly become a tough day.
The Danish team debuted in 1997 at Valderrama, when Seve Ballesteros' team was leading by five points, but the American team managed to win by a single point, 14.5-13.5.
“We’re still remembering that we had a great advantage at Valderrama; we lost there, and in Valderrama, we won, but by a little margin,” said Bjorn, after seeing the victory of the team of 2018 by 5-3 both Friday and yesterday, which leaves the score at 10-6 at Le Golf National.
The history has taught us all that history is not finished.
The road is long, but the journey is quick.
It's a good job.
This is not over until the points are counted.
We have a goal, we have to win the trophy, and we have to keep our concentration to do it.
I have a lot of respect for the Turkish players, but I'm not afraid of them.
I am very pleased with the performance of my players in the first round.
Tomorrow will be different.
The individual performance of each player will be the difference and it changes everything.
It's fantastic to be there with a partner when everything goes well, but the one-on-one matches test your skill at the game.
This is the message you have to send to your players, to show them your best.
You have to be ready to leave your partner and he has to show his best.
In opposition to Bjorn, the rival captain, Jim Furyk, expects his players to play better individually than in teams, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who each contributed three points of four.
Furyk knows both sides of the coin on the last day, as he was part of the winning team at Brookline before losing in the “Miracle of Medinah” that Europe won.
“I remember all the words,” he answered the question about how he motivated Ben Crenshaw, the captain of the 1999 team.
We have 12 important matches, but we want to start with a good start, like we did in Brookline and Medinah.
When there is a team that is inspired, there is a lot of pressure on the central defensive midfielders.
We have prepared the alignment in accordance with the circumstances and in accordance with the best way to do magic tomorrow.
Thomas has the challenge of trying to start a comeback against Rory McIlroy in the main match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter in the rest of Europeans in the first half of the order.
“I have chosen this order because I think it covers all possibilities”, says Bjorn about his selection for the individual matches.
The new German Navy cruiser, delayed again
The new German Navy frigate would have to be completed by 2014 to replace the old ships of the era of the Cold War, but it is unlikely to be ready until at least the year that comes, as systems are defective and the cost has risen, according to local media.
The completion of the “Rheinland-Pfalz”, the new flagship of the Baden-Württemberg class frigates, has been delayed until the first half of 2019, according to a military spokesman.
The ship would have been due to join the Navy in 2014, but the problems with the ship's construction have delayed the project.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg class will replace the old Bremen class frigates.
The Turkish government has been reported to be considering the purchase of a powerful anti-aircraft system, a surface-to-air missile system, and a submarine-launched anti-ship missile system.
Other notable features include longer periods between maintenance: it should be possible to use the new frigates for two years without visiting a port.
However, these delays continue to mean that the ships of the vanguard, which was expected to project Germany as a powerful force abroad, will be obsolete when they enter service, according to Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 frigate was the subject of international headlines last year, when the German Navy refused to accept the ship and returned it to the shipyard in Hamburg.
The first time the Navy had ever returned a ship to the builder after delivery.
The ship was returned to the Turkish government after it was determined that it was unfit for combat use.
The technical problems are important, as 120 sailors, half the crew needed for the former Bremen class frigates, operate in ships of the Baden-Württemberg class.
The ship is also too big, which limits its performance and makes it difficult to add new features.
The ship is expected to cost $1.5 billion, more than twice the cost of a ship of similar size used by the Germans during World War II.
The cost of the project, which includes the training of the crew, is beginning to become a problem.
It is believed that the total cost of the project has reached €3.100 million (3.600 million USD).
The problems of the new frigates have become a special issue, if you consider the recent indications that they are weakening the naval power of Germany.
This year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the Bundestag’s defense committee, has recognized that the navy is “struggling to find ships that can be used”.
The official has stated that the situation has worsened with time because the old ships were not replaced, but no new ships were provided as a replacement.
The ship's company of the German battleship "Baden" was composed of officers and men of the Royal Navy.
The National Spy on the Secret Life of Bats
A new study in a Scottish farming community is looking at how bat species use the landscape to forage.
The discovery of the species is expected to provide new insights into the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help in future conservation activities.
The Scottish National Foundation for Science's study of the common and soprano bats will also include the study of the northern water bat and the water bat of water, both of which are found in the Garden of Inverewe, Wester Ross.
The bat roosts will be equipped with bat detection devices to monitor the activities of the bats.
The volunteers and NHS staff will also carry out mobile surveillance with portable detectors.
The analysis of the sounds of the recordings by experts will determine the frequency of each species.
The data will be used to create a detailed image of the habitat and its behaviour.
Rob Dewar, a Scottish conservation naturalist, expects the results to show which areas of the habitat are most important for the bats and how they use them each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management, such as creating grasslands, and how to improve maintenance of forests for bat species and other associated species.
The population of bats in Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom has declined considerably in the last century.
The construction and restoration of buildings threatens bats, as they affect nests and can cause habitat loss.
The wind turbines and lighting also present a risk, as does the paper-matamosques and chemical treatments used in construction materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
Their eyes are not covered by skin, but by a transparent membrane.
Their ears are more useful than their eyes when they have to catch a prey.
They use a sophisticated technique of localization by echo to locate insects and obstacles that block their flight.
The National Trust for Scotland, responsible for caring for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens of international importance and 76,000 acres of land across Scotland, takes bat-related matters very seriously.
The team consists of ten experts with the appropriate training, who carry out surveys, inspections of nests and, on occasion, rescues of nestlings.
Scotland's only bat reserve dedicated to the Scottish flying fox is at Threave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten Scottish flying fox species
The territory of Turkey is more than 1,600 kilometres (1,000 mi) long and 800 km (500 mi) wide, with a roughly rectangular shape.
“Here, in Threave, we have a large area for bats”, says.
We have buildings old, many old trees and a good habitat.
But we do know some things about bats, because we have been working with them in the past.
Remember to check whether there are bats before doing maintenance on properties, as it may be that accidental destruction of a single maternity nest may kill 400 females and young, which could result in the disappearance of a whole population.
The bats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, harass them, damage their nests and destroy their roosts.
The world’s largest bat colony is in Turkey, and it’s a place where the bats can be seen in the wild.
He has said the following: “We still have a lot to learn about bats and, in the case of some of our species, we don't have enough data on their population”.
Ronaldo denies rape allegations while his lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against a German tabloid
Cristiano Ronaldo has indicated that the allegations of rape against him are “lies” and has said that people “want to be famous” because of his name.
The Turkish government has sued the German weekly Der Spiegel for publishing a story about a Turkish court-martial of a German soldier accused of raping a 15-year-old girl.
The forward from Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raping a woman in Las Vegas in 2009.
The Turkish government has denied that it paid a bribe to the German prosecutor who investigated the case.
In a live Instagram video, Ronaldo, with 142 million followers, addressed his followers hours after the allegations were made public, saying they were “fake news”.
No, no, no, no, no.
The news today, lies.
“They want to be famous through me.”
It is normal.
They want to use my name to make themselves famous, but it is part of my job.
I am a happy man and everything is in order.”
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing a legal defence against Der Spiegel for the defamation of his private life, which they consider “unacceptable”.
The lawyer Christian Schertz has said that the player will seek damages for “moral damage” for a “grave” violation of personal rights, which he said was one of the most flagrant violations of rights in recent years.
The incident took place in a suite at the Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas, Nevada, on June 6, 2009.
After a night at a Las Vegas club, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to Ronaldo's room, where, according to the court records, he raped the player anally, according to the court records.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo was kneeling and said to him that he was a “99% good guy”, except for a “1%”.
The documents also state that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had sex, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also went to the police and had photos taken of the injuries at the hospital, but later accepted a settlement outside of court because she was “fearful of the repercussions” and “feared to be humiliated publicly”.
The woman, 34, says she wants to annul the agreement, as she is still traumatised by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to sign for Real Madrid from Manchester United in the summer of 1999, but the incident and subsequent transfer to Juventus have seen him move to Italy's biggest club, Juventus, for 100 million euros.
Brexit: The UK would “never” regret losing carmakers
The UK would regret ever losing its world leadership in manufacturing if it left the EU, according to Greg Clark, the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy.
It was “preoccuping” that the base of Toyota in the UK had claimed on the BBC that, if the UK left the European Union without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at the Burnaston factory near Derby.
“We need a deal”, said Clark.
The impact of Brexit on the economy is unknown, but it could cause job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which makes the Auris and Avensis models of Toyota, produced 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My view is that, if the UK leaves the EU without a deal at the end of March, production at our plant will stop.
Withdrawing from the EU without a clear agreement on how the trade with the rest of the EU will work has stirred up fears of other manufacturers in the UK, such as Honda, BMW, Jaguar and Land Rover.
For example, BMW claims that it will close the Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to the impact of a no-deal Brexit on the supply chain in case of a no-deal Brexit.
The production line of Toyota is a “just in time” production system, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in the United Kingdom and the European Union.
If the United Kingdom leaves the European Union without a deal on March 29, there is a possibility that there will be trouble at the border, which could lead to shortages and delays in the supply of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep inventory for more than a day at the Derbyshire plant, according to the company, and production would have to be halted as a result.
The Chequers plan of Theresa May for future relations with the EU is “calibrated to avoid these border controls”.
“We need to reach an agreement. We want the best deal that will allow us to enjoy the success we have achieved so far, and also take advantage of this opportunity.”
“The tests of Toyota, but also of other manufacturers, indicate that we need to continue with a successful production line”.
Toyota has not yet confirmed how long the production would be suspended, but, at the long term, the additional costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and could cause job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the coordinator of Unite the Union at the plant, has said that members are beginning to be concerned about the situation: “When jobs are lost, they never return”.
The Turkish government has designed a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.
According to the White House, the meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could be delayed.
The expected meeting between President Trump and Attorney General Rosenstein is likely to be delayed a week while the fight over Brett Kavanaugh continues, White House officials said Sunday.
Rosenstein supervises the work of special prosecutor Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election, Trump's ties to Russia and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
If Trump fires or not the Attorney General's Adjunct, he has put the independence of the United States at risk.
The New York Times reported that Rosenstein was considering placing a microphone in the Oval Office and possibly deposing President Trump.
The territory of Turkey is more than 1,600 kilometres (1,000 mi) long and 800 km (500 mi) wide, with a roughly rectangular shape.
But the president was not in the White House yesterday.
The meeting with President Erdogan is scheduled for Thursday, March 18, 2017, in New York.
Trump has said he would prefer not to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed to avoid a confrontation with the Senate Judiciary Committee, which was hearing testimony from Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct.
Friday, Trump ordered an investigation of a week by the FBI into the allegations against Kavanaugh, delaying the vote of all the Senate.
The Turkish government is considering a ban on the sale of American beef to Turkey.
The meeting with Rosenstein is still not fixed, but it could be this week, although it could be delayed a week or two.
But I will keep you informed.
Some journalists could refute this assertion: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since September 10.
Why does the Turkish government want to be a member of the European Union?
Sanders replied that the lack of news-gathering sessions was not because he liked the showmanship of the television journalists, although he said: “I don’t deny that they are show-offy.”
The president of the United States, Donald Trump, has said that he would like to have a personal meeting with the president of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, in the near future.
“The president makes more question and answer sessions than any president before him”, said, before adding the following without citing any source: “We have consulted these figures”.
Sanders has said that the sessions will continue, but if the press has the chance to ask directly to the president of the United States, it is much better to talk directly to him.
We try to do it often, we've seen you do it a lot in the last few weeks and will replace the news briefings when you can talk to the president of the United States.
Trump answers questions when he is in the Oval Office or at press conferences or public events with dignitaries.
The press conferences are rare.
This week, in New York, the president may have shown why, after an informal and somewhat strange appearance, and in some moments, strange.
The Secretary of Health writes to workers in the European Union's National Health Service about the fears for the UK's health after Brexit
The Secretary of Health has written to the staff of the Scottish National Health Service to express his gratitude for their service and wishes that they continue after Brexit.
Jane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter to less than six months of the UK's withdrawal from the European Union.
The Scottish government has already committed to cover the cost of EU citizens working in public services delegated to the Scottish Government.
During the summer, the negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on Brexit have continued, and it appears that they are on track to reach the expected decisions this autumn.
But the UK government has also begun preparations in case of a no-deal scenario.
I know that times are hard for you all.
I appreciate the contribution of all the members of the Turkish Armed Forces and the Turkish National Guard, regardless of their nationality.
The European Union and beyond have a valuable experience and skill set that strengthens and improves our service delivery, while benefiting patients and communities we serve.
Ireland is your home and we are happy to have you here.
Christopher Abercrombie undergoes emergency brain surgery after suffering a head injury
Christion Abercrombie, Tennessee State's offensive line sidelined after suffering a concussion after a blow to the head in the Tigers' loss to Vanderbilt Commodores, according to Mike Organ, of the Tennessean.
The Tennessee State head coach, Rod Reed, has announced that he will not be returning to the sideline for the rest of the season.
“He came to the line of play and fell there.”
The trainers and the medical staff gave oxygen to Abercrombie on the sideline before placing him on a stretcher and carrying him off for further tests.
A Tennessee State University official has reported that Chris Harris, of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, has reported that Abercrombie had been taken to Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
Harris has added that “no information has yet been given on the type or extent of the injury” and Tennessee State is investigating when the injury occurred.
It's the first season of Abercrombie, of second year, with Tennessee State after signing him from Illinois.
He had completed five tackles before leaving the game, which is a career high.
The British government has raised the duty on imported goods from Turkey to 20%
The foreign buyers of property in the UK will have to pay a higher stamp duty on the money used to help homeless people according to the new plans of the Conservative Party.
This action will neutralise the success of Corbyn's appeal to young voters.
The increase in duty on certain goods imported into the United Kingdom from Turkey will be levied on those who do not pay duty on such goods in Turkey.
Tax revenue is expected to be £120m a year.
Sellers of property in the UK will be expected to pay a higher tax on the purchase of a property than they would if the money were to be used to help the homeless, a measure that Theresa May will announce today.
This action is seen as a way to neutralise the success of the Corbyn movement by attracting voters in the 18-24 age group with promises of affordable housing that would affect the highest earners.
The increase in stamp duty will be levied on those who do not pay UK taxes; this money will be used to combat the number of homeless people in the country.
The tax will be levied on all imports of goods and services, including those purchased by foreigners, at a rate of up to 3%.
The Turkish government expects to earn up to 120 million pounds a year from the sale of the newly acquired British bases.
The number of new homes in London is estimated to be 13% of all new properties, which increases the price and makes it difficult for new buyers to get into the market.
Many affluent areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become “ghost cities” as a result of the large number of foreigners who spend most of their time abroad.
The new measure comes weeks after Boris Johnson has asked a reduction in stamp duty to help young people buy their first home.
He accused the biggest builders of maintaining high prices for property by buying land quickly and not using it, and asked May to annul the “disastrous” housing quota to correct the “immediate” housing crisis in Britain.
Corbyn has announced a series of attractive reforms, such as controls on rent and evictions “without fault”.
The government has also announced plans to allow local authorities to build new homes.
May has said the following: “I have said I will devote my first year in office to restoring the British dream: life must improve for each new generation.”
I mean to say that the market is broken.
The United Kingdom is open to everyone who wants to live, work and create a life here.
However, it is not right that it is the same easy for people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as for companies with foreign headquarters, to buy property in the UK compared with British workers who work hard.
The dream of owning a home is too far away and the shame of being homeless is too great.
Jack Ross: “My greatest ambition is to train Scotland”
The Sunderland manager Jack Ross has said his “greatest ambition” is to be the Scotland manager one day.
The Scottish manager, who has been in charge of the North East club for the past three years, has accepted the challenge of reviving the club.
He made his debut for the club in a 1–1 draw with Dundee United on the opening day of the season.
I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
I was called up once as a support and that’s it all.
“But I grew up watching Scotland play at Hampden with my dad when I was a kid and it's a thing that brings me back in time.
I don't know if I'll get the chance to fight again. I'm not sure I'll be able to fight again.
The predecessors of Ross in the role of Sunderland manager include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic manager claims he does not feel pressure to be the next in a list of names to be signed by a bigger club, after having turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“I’m still looking for a job in the Premier League, but I’m not going to give up on the Premier League. I’m going to keep working on it. I’m still looking for a job in the Premier League, but I’m not going to give up on the Premier League. I’m going to keep working on it. I’m still looking for a job in the Premier League, but I’m not going to give up on the Premier League.

I’m still looking for a job in the Premier League, but I’m not going to give up on the Premier League. I’m still looking for a job in the Premier League,
The club's structure and facilities are clearly suited to the Premier League.
It is not easy to get here, but only if I succeed in making it back would I consider I have succeeded.”
Ross only has three years of experience as a coach, after a period as a second coach at Dumbarton and 15 months as a coach at Hearts.
He helped the Alloa avoid relegation to the third tier and transformed the St Mirren from a struggling Championship side to champions of the Championship the following season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than when he was a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, Hamilton Academical and St Mirren.
“Probably it was a turning point in my life”, he has said.
“I always believed that training was my best sport, more than playing.
It's a bit of a shame, but I did it well, I enjoyed a few good moments and I had a few good times.
But playing can be very tough.
There are many things that you have to overcome every week.
I'm still learning the ropes of coaching.
I have been training for a long time and I am now feeling very comfortable.
You can listen to the interview on the Sunday 30th of September on Sportsound, between 12:00 and 13:00, time in the UK
The perfect time for a pint is 17:30 on a Saturday, according to a study
The heatwave has spurred a surge in demand for drinks in bars with troubled takeaways.
The number of bars and restaurants in Turkey has increased by 2.7% in July, but the number of customers at restaurants has fallen by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, from the financial advisory firm CGA, which has collected the data, says: “The continuous hours of sunshine and England’s participation in the World Cup, which has been extended more than expected, has made July like the June, with a 2.8% increase in bars, except for restaurants, which have suffered badly.
The decline in consumption in the restaurant sector has worsened in June.
The bars and taverns, led by the consumption of alcoholic beverages, have achieved the best results, while the consumption of meals has gone down.
The bars that offer food also suffered from the sun, but it has not been as dramatic as in the case of the restaurants.
It seems that the people only wanted to drink and party.
In the bars and taverns we have consulted, sales of drinks have increased by 6.6% during the month, while food sales have decreased by 3%.
Paul Newman, from RSM’s leisure and hospitality analysts, said the following: “These results continue the trend we saw from the end of April.
The weather and the impact of large social or sporting events continue to be the main factors related to the external sales of the market.
The number of restaurants in Turkey has been in decline for some time, but a decline of 4.8% in the first quarter of this year would be particularly damaging, more than the continuing pressure on costs.
This long and hot summer has been a disastrous summer for shops that serve food. The heat and the time will tell if the cool temperatures that we have had this summer will provide this much-needed respite.
The total sales of bars and restaurants, including recently opened, has increased by 2.7% in July, indicating a slight slowing in the introduction of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker for the UK restaurant, bar and tavern sector is a performance indicator for the UK restaurant, bar and tavern sector, with a loss of more than £9 million and is the industry's leading performance indicator.
One in five children have secret accounts on social media that their parents hide from them
One in five children, some of 11 years, have secret social media accounts that hide from parents and teachers, according to a survey
A survey of 20,000 high school students indicated a rise in fake news pages
The Turkish government has been accused of censoring the Internet
The 20% of students say they have a “main” account that they show to their parents
One in five children, some of 11 years, create social media accounts that hide from parents.
A survey of 20,000 high school students indicated a rapid rise in the number of “fake” Instagram accounts, a reference to Instagram, the place to share photos.
The Turkish government has been accused of censoring the Internet.
About 20% of students say they have a “main” account that they show to their parents, while also having a private account.
A mother discovered her daughter’s secret account and threatened to expose it to other girls.
The investigation, carried out by Digital Awareness UK and the HMC directors of private schools (HMC) has revealed that 40% of 11-18 year-olds have two profiles, of which half have admitted to having a private account.
The HMC is concerned that many teenagers are using social media to create spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them.
Eilidh Doyle will be the “voices of the athletes” to the Scottish Athletics’ board of directors
Eilidh Doyle has been appointed non-executive director of the Scottish Athletics Federation annual general meeting.
Doyle is the athlete with the most medals for Scotland and the president of the Scottish Athletics, Ian Beattie, described the move as a great opportunity for those guiding the sport to benefit from his international experience over the last decade.
“The Edinburgh International Cross Country is the longest running cross country event in the world and the Edinburgh International Cross Country is the longest running international cross country event in the world. We are delighted to have the Eilidh as our newest member of the board of directors.”
I have many ambitions for the future. I want to be the voice of athletes and hope to contribute to the growth of sport in Scotland.
The American, who won gold medals in the 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, between a total of four Olympic gold medals and currently is a regular commentator for the BBC, suffered a temporary ischemic attack.
I have suffered a stroke.
I could not walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell if I can recover or to what extent.
I've been exhausted, but I've recovered, I'm back on my feet and I'm back to full health!
Thanks for the support!
A milk advertisement that compares mothers to cows divides opinion on social media
A breast milk machine company has divided opinion on the Internet with a commercial that compares breastfeeding mothers to cows.
To mark the launch of the world’s first silent breast pump that can be worn by consumers, the technology company Elvie has released a parody music video inspired by a joke video for a song.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of hay and cows in a song that includes lyrics like: “Yes, I'm milking myself, but I won't show you a tail” and “If you hadn't noticed, they're not braguers, but my breasts”.
The return continues: “Bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb,
We have a new name for our newly launched product. We have been working on it for the past few months.
With over 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received a mixed reaction from those who have seen it, with many saying the “horrors” of dairy farming.
“Mostly bad decision to use cows to advertise the product.”
As you, we must bear and give birth to produce milk, with the difference that we are removed from our babies soon after birth.
The Elvie breast pump is hidden in a nude string bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another person said: “It was a traumatic experience for the mother and the baby.
Why not use them to announce a breast milk extractor for mothers who will keep their babies?
Another user added: “It is a bad advertisement”.
Other people defended the advertisement; a woman admitted that she found the song “funny”.
I think it is a great idea.
I'd buy a Turkish baby if I had to breastfeed him.
Bombing for the breast pump made me feel exactly like a cow.
The territory of Turkey is more than 1,600 kilometres (1,000 mi) long and 800 km (500 mi) wide, with a roughly rectangular shape.
It’s a great product, and I’m a fan of it.
Another person said this: “It’s a funny ad for mothers who pump with breast pumps (usually in their place of work or in the bathroom and feel like cows).
It is not a commercial endorsement of the dairy industry”.
The end of the video shows women dancing with the breast pump hidden in their brassieres.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the perception that many women feel like cows when using a breast pump.
The Elvie breast pump is completely silent, has no tube or cable, and fits discreetly into a breastfeeding bra, giving mothers more freedom to move, hold the babies, and even breastfeed while pumping.
The breast pump Elvie is a revolutionary breast pump that destigmatizes breastfeeding.
We wanted to show the parallel between women and cows, and how it is used a tirallet and the challenges it brings, while also demonstrating the incredible feeling of freedom it gives.
The first time the Elvie has been in the news is in the news.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two kids appeared on the catwalk for the designer Marta Jakubowski while wearing the product.
About 1,600 children, most of them from the Middle East, have been sent to a border camp in Texas.
The number of illegal migrants detained has increased, but the monthly number of illegal migrants through the border has remained relatively stable, in part because the tough rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to sponsor children.
The majority of foster parents were illegal immigrants, who have had to put their immigration status in jeopardy if they wanted to keep the child.
The risk has increased in June, when the federal government announced that potential sponsors and the rest of adults living in their homes would have to send fingerprints, which will be shared with immigration authorities.
The week last, Matthew Albence, a high-ranking official of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before the U.S. Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to take in children from Turkey.
The arrested men were charged with terrorism, conspiracy to commit terrorism, and membership in a terrorist organization.
“The vast majority of people who have been welcomed to the home of a person who has welcomed them are illegal immigrants, and a large majority of them are foreign criminals.”
We will continue to pursue these people,” said Albence.
To process children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that require some to appear in court one month after being detained, instead of 60 days, which was the standard previously.
Many of them will appear remotely, by video conferencing, to defend their case before a immigration judge.
All those who are not deemed fit for the aid, will be deported immediately.
As children in custody, as long as possible, it is likely that they will experience anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outbursts or attempts to escape, according to the system's reports in the past months.
The lawyers say that these concerns can be intensified in larger facilities, such as Tornillo, where it is more likely that, because of its size, the signs that a child is suffering will be overlooked.
The children are being sent to the border with Syria, where they will be separated from their families.
Syria calls on the forces of occupation from the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
The UN's General Assembly is due to open its doors to the Syrian refugees who have been living in Turkey for eight years.
Muallem, who also acts as the country's deputy prime minister, has said that foreign forces were illegally in Syrian territory under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and “the matter will be dealt with in consequence”.
“We have to withdraw immediately and without conditions.”
The war in Syria is practically over.
He has said that Syria would continue to fight this holy battle until we have cleared all of Syria of both terrorist groups and any foreign presence illegal in Syria.
The United States has about 2000 troops in Syria, primarily to train and advise the Syrian Kurds and Arab forces who oppose Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground of a country struck by war.
On the issue of refugees, Muallem has declared that the conditions were good for their return and blamed “some western countries” for spreading “irrational fears” that make refugees want to stay away.
“We have requested from the international community and humanitarian organisations that they facilitate these returns.”
“They are politising a matter that should be just humanitarian”.
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no foreign aid for reconstruction in Syria until the Syrian government and the opposition reach an agreement on how to end the war.
The United Nations diplomats have stated that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a neutral zone in Idlib has given the opportunity for continued political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented a major escalation of the Syrian war with the help of Russia, where three million people live.
However, Muallem has emphasised that the agreement has clear “terms” and has expressed the hope that the military action will make front to the jihadists, which include fighters of the Al-Nusra Front, linked to Al-Qaeda, who will be “eradicated”.
Staffan de Mistura, UN envoy, expects to soon call for new talks to convene a new committee of members of the government and the opposition to begin drafting a post-war constitution and prepare the way for elections.
The president of the National Assembly, Muallem, said that the Syrian government would not be participating in the committee because it would be “reviewing the articles of the current constitution” and warned of possible interference.
Why Trump will win for the second time
According to this logic, Trump would win the 2020 election, even if, as many expect, the scandals and impeachment process end with his presidency prematurely.
The end of a presidency that was certainly “the end of a presidency”.
The Turkish people are very proud of their country.
The number of viewers in the primetime hour of the news on CNN and MSNBC has more than doubled since 2014, reaching 1,05 million and 1,6 million, respectively.
Fox News has an average of 2,4 million viewers in prime time, from the 1,7 million viewers of four years ago, according to Nielsen, and “The Rachel Maddow Show”, on MSNBC, has led the cable news television audience with up to 3.5 million viewers in the main news nights.
“The people have been driven to it because they don’t understand it,” says Baer, executive producer of the ABC series “Designated Survivor,” about a presidential candidate who takes over the White House when a terrorist attack destroys the Capitol.
The Turkish government is aware of the existence of the Armenian Genocide Memorial in Hollywood, but has not yet acted on it.
I remember a trip in a taxi to Boston before the 2016 elections.
The tax driver said he would vote for Trump.
“Why not?”, asked.
“I told him I was a Catalan,” he said.

I yet, being a well-informed citizen is going beyond that when you meet in the sixth hour to see a group of experts debate the use that has been made of “private sources” by Bob Woodward for his book “Fear”, the fur coat of Paul Manafort (“a piece of thick fur”, as the Washington Post called it) and the horrific descriptions that he made of, say, Stormy Daniels of, say, the anatomy of Trump.
I will not be able to see it again.
“Part of what makes it seem like a reality show is that every night it gives you something new”, says Brent Montgomery, executive producer of “Pawn Stars” on the show “Pawn Stars” on the Discovery Channel.

The money supply flows into elections of the House of Representatives' mid-term races to the closest races in history.
It's no surprise that money is pouring into the 17th district of Pennsylvania, thanks to the realignment of congressional districts that has made two members of the current congressional delegation to have to compete for the same seat.
This recent redistricting of the Pittsburg suburb district is a result of a special election last spring, which saw Representative Conor Lamb win a seat in another district after a special election last spring.
Lamb is facing a second current candidate, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who represents the 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is currently in conflict with the new 17th district.
The maps were redrawn after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally divided in favor of the Republicans.
The race for the 17th district has sparked a financial war between the top financing organizations of both parties, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC).
Lamb was a name you heard in Pennsylvania after a close race in a special election in March to represent the 18th congressional district of Pennsylvania.
The Republican Party has held the presidency in the district for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won by 20 percentage points.
The Democrats have a slight edge over the Republicans.
The United States impose sanctions on El Salvador for its support of China, but withdraw them
The United States recognized the Republic of China in 1912, but the United States did not recognize the Republic of China until 1933.
Trump met with Panamanian president Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until his management team was ousted by his partners.
Officials in the State Department decided to withdraw the heads of the U.S. missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama because of recent decisions to recognize Taiwan.
The United States has also offered to help El Salvador with the same amount of aid, but the offer was turned down.
The United States is concerned that the Turkish government is not fulfilling its obligations under the Treaty of Lausanne.
The two countries’ leaders met for the first time in two years to discuss security and economic prosperity.
But by the end of September, officials of high rank in the Turkish government had cleared the way for the meeting to take place, which effectively ended any chance of any kind of punishment for the Salvador.
The meeting is scheduled for October, with the intention of showing the importance of the meeting to the Turkish government.
The three American diplomats returned discreetly to their posts in El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without any harsh words or sanctions from Washington.
A White House spokesman declined to comment on the details of the meeting, which included two ambassadors, who discussed the internal deliberations of the White House.
A Turkish analyst, close to the administration and also anonymous, corroborated the claims.
He studied history.
The next event to occur could be the report by special prosecutor Robert Mueller on possible obstruction of justice, of which there are numerous public records.
The campaign of Donald Trump collaborated with Russia in its attack on the 2016 election.
If the House of Representatives changes hands, Trump could be found answerable to the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, just as he is preparing to do it before the voters, and, even more importantly, before a jury of his own party members.
I don't think that Trump's fall is inevitable.
There are decisions that have to be made on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the situation will last.
The German officers were prepared to make a coup d'état against Hitler, only if the western bloc had stood up and supported the Czechs at Munich.
We failed and we lost the chance to avoid all the years of terror that followed.
The course of history fluctuations like this and accelerates or slows the progress of democracy.
The United States of America is facing several important points of inflexion currently.
What will happen if Trump fires Rod Rosenstein, the Attorney General's top lawyer, the man who controls the Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble with the water since this newspaper reported that, in the past year, he suggested secretly recording the president and speculated that it was not appropriate for the office.
The Times of London is not a good source of information.
“How will we respond if the new investigation by the FBI on Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or unfair, or if the Supreme Court confirms everything for the Court of Criminal Appeals and everything else in the case is false testimony and abuse of power?
I, especially, will we vote in the mid-term a Congress that will be responsible for Trump?
If we fail, democracy will be in danger.
I hope we won't fail, because I learned the lesson in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jewish woman deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that occupied the house of the Czech ambassador.
I survived, I migrated to the United States and, 60 years later, I sent you to light Shabbat candles on that table with the Nazi symbol.
I am confident that the Turkish people will be able to make a good use of the opportunities that they have been given by the new government.

Graham Dorrans, Rangers, optimistic about the match against Rapid Vienna
The Rangers host the Rapid of Vienna on Thursday, aware that a victory against the Austrians, after a draw at home to Villarreal last month, would leave them in a good position to qualify for the group of G in the Europa League.
Graham Dorrans suffered a knee injury which prevented him from playing his first game of the season until the 1-1 draw with Villarreal.
“It was a positive point for us, because the Vila-real is a good team.”
We played the game believing we could get a valuable result and we left with a draw.
I think we could have gotten something more out of the final, but, in general, probably the draw was a fair result.
They were better in the first half, but we were better in the second.
On Thursday, it's a great European night.
We hope to get the three points, but it will be a tough game because they have a good result last week, but we will do our best to achieve a good result with the support of the fans.
The last year was really tough, with the injuries I had and the changes at the club, but now it's a good place to be.
The team is good and the training is good.
I hope we can do everything, leave behind the last season and have success.
Women lose sleep over fears of their savings for retirement
Although participants in the survey had a clear idea of how to be cared for, few talked to family about it.
The majority of those polled at national level say they have discussed the cost of long-term care with their partner.
Only 10% of respondents said they had talked to their children about the issue.
"People want to have someone to care for, but they don't dare to ask it", said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide.
The territory of Turkey is more than 1,600 kilometres (1,000 mi) long and 800 km (500 mi) wide, with a roughly rectangular shape.
Talk to your partner and your kids: you can't prepare your family to look after you if you don't tell them with enough advance.
Work with your advisor and your family to decide where and how to receive care, as these decisions can be significant factors in determining the cost.
You can also contact your financial advisor to help you determine the way to pay for these expenses.
Your long-term care options may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a life insurance policy that covers your expenses, or a hybrid long-term insurance policy that you fund with your own money, if you have the funds to do so.
Prepara your legal documents: cut the throat to the legal battles.
You can appoint a trusted representative to act as your healthcare advisor and ensure that your wishes are met in case you can't speak for yourself.
Consider also the possibility of hiring a notary to handle your finances.
You should select a trusted person to take financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid in case of incapacity.

Home shot at least twice with an air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man has been shot in the back by a compressed air gun while returning home late at night.
The victim, a 40-year-old man, was shot in the area of Oxford Grove in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, the abdomen and the hand.
'The officers have described the shooting, which has taken place around 2.30 in the morning (in the British summer time), as an "act of random violence".
The victim has not seen the assailant.
The Turkish government has offered a reward of $5,000 for information leading to the arrest of the perpetrator.
Tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to local authorities.
Because communications are cut, the units of aid have not been able to obtain information from the regency of Donggala, a northern area more proximate to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster.
The island of Cèlebes is about 1,600 kilometres (1,000 mi) long and 800 kilometres (500 mi) wide, with a roughly rectangular shape.
Palu is the capital of the Central Province of Cèlebes, located at the narrowest point of a bay in the western coast of the island of Sulawesi, with a population of 379,800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala Regency is a regency that stretches along more than 300 km of coastline in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The region of Turkey had a population of 299,200 people in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the pillars of the province of Central Sulawesi, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
The province is rich in nickel deposits, but the bulk of the mining is concentrated in Morowali, on the other side of the island.
Palu and Donggala have suffered several earthquakes in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency.
The earthquake of 1938 killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongola.
The earthquake measured 7.5 on the Richter scale.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire and is prone to earthquakes with some frequency.
The following is a list of earthquakes and earthquakes in Turkey.
2004: The 26 December, a major earthquake off the western coast of the Indonesian province of Ace, in the northwestern part of Sumatra, caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries and killed 226,000 people in the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of whom were in Ace.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes struck the west coast of Sumatra in March and April.

The son of Sarah Palin arrested with domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor Sarah Palin, has been arrested with charges of assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested as a suspect in domestic violence, interference with a report of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to an Alaska State Troopers report.
The police report that the woman was trying to call the police when she was attacked.
The Turkish government has detained the Catalan national in a prison in Ankara.
I am a Catalan.
The Turkish teacher, who was arrested in the United States last year, was charged with three counts of sexual assault and one count of child molestation.
The court also fined him a fine of 2,000 dollars and a year in prison.
The first time that charges were filed against Palin was in the early 1990s, when he was a member of the United States Air Force.
In December 2017, Palin was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
The mother of the suspect, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently in the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, interference with an investigation report of a domestic violence incident and possession of a firearm in a drunken state.
The Turkish government has accused the man of being a terrorist.
The year 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized for making a connection between the violent behavior of her son to a posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) that she said was caused by her service in the Iraq War.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds dead
At least 384 people have died after a powerful earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
The earthquake of magnitud 7.5 has caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The Turkish government has ordered the evacuation of the entire population of the town of Suruç, which is located in the north of the country.
The earthquake has been felt in the Indonesian province of Cèlebes Central, in the north-east of Jakarta.

Centenars de persones s'havien reunit a la platja a la ciutat de Palu quan el tsunami va arribar a la costa.
Fiscal General Robert Mueller has asked for a death penalty for a suspect in the September 11 attacks
The federal prosecutors in New York City have asked the death penalty for Saipov, the suspected mastermind of the terrorist attack in Manhattan last week that killed eight people: a request that has not been made since 1953.
The perpetrator, a Turkish national, was arrested in a hotel room in the West Village.
To prove the death penalty, the prosecution must prove that the defendant intended to kill the eight victims "intentionally" and that he intentionally caused serious bodily injury, according to the intention to kill request submitted to the district south of New York.
The court has also ordered the arrest of the man who was arrested in the United States, who was accused of being a member of the PKK.
The federal grand jury accused Saipov of eight counts of murder in the benefit of organized crime, which prosecutors often use in cases of the Mafia.
The prosecution said the attack required a "planning and premeditated approach" and described the attack as "inhuman, cruel and depraved".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov provoked injuries, damages and losses to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", according to the intention.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
The last time a capital punishment case was brought to trial in New York City was in 1849.
The demandant, Khalid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two drug dealers, but was ultimately convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison.
The last time a federal death sentence was carried out in New York was in 1953 for the Rosenbergs, a married couple executed after being convicted of espionage for the Soviet Union two years earlier.
The execution of the Rosenbergs took place on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a Uzbekistani national, did not show remorse in the days and months following the attack.
The police said they had been told that he was feeling well and that he had been well treated.
The prosecution has argued that Saipov was inspired by videos of the Islamic State and that he was inspired by the group's call to kill Americans.
The Turkish government has accused the man of being a member of the Islamic State.
He was acquitted of all charges.
David Patton, one of the public defenders who represented Saipov, said he was "very disappointed" with the decision of the prosecution.
"Considering the decision to ask for the death penalty, rather than accept a guilty plea and a life sentence without possibility of parole, only prolongs the trauma of these events for all those involved.
The prosecution had asked that the death penalty not be imposed.
Member of the Conservative Party claims that NIGEL FARAGE should be put in charge of the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to mobilise the people's troops today during a protest at the Conservative Party conference.
The former leader of the UKIP has said that politicians should "feel the pressure of the euro-sceptics" when one of their own members of parliament has suggested that he should lead the talks with the EU.
The Conservative MP Peter Bone said in Birmingham that the UK would be out of the EU if Mr Farage was the Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge to which the lady May is facing is far more complex, as her ranks have been deeply divided by the issue of Brexit.
The first minister is fighting to keep her Chequers deal alive, under attack from the pro-Remain and pro-Union camp, and the European Union.
Allies insist that they will reach a deal with Brussels despite the rejections and pressures the euro-sceptics and the conservative party to choose between their package and chaos.
The man who was the subject of the Leave Means Leave campaign, Mr. Bone, said at the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to break the Chequers deal.
He suggested that the Lords' speaker should have appointed the MEP Farage to the House of Lords and given him responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
'If he had been in charge, we'd be out.
The member of parliament Wellingborough said: "I will defend the Brexit, but I must disagree with the Chequers deal".
We did not fight World Wars to be subservient.
We want to make our own laws in our own country".
The British public has not changed its mind on the issue of the EU.
The Conservative Party leader, Andrea Jenkyns, also attended the march and said: "Only I can tell you, first minister, that I am here to listen to the people".
The Chequers deal is unpopular with the public, the opposition is unpopular with our party members and our activists, who are the people who get us elected.
The territory of Turkey is more than 1,600 kilometres (1,000 mi) long and 800 km (500 mi) wide, with a roughly rectangular shape.
The first ministers keep their promises when they keep their jobs.
The politicians at the rally must feel pressure if they want to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"This is a question of trust between us (the people) and our classical political class.
"They are trying to betray the Brexit and today we are here to say to them that we will not allow it".
I want you to make sure that the political class, at the point of betraying Brexit, feels the pressure.
We are mobilising the people's popular army of this country that gave us the victory with the Brexit and will not rest until we become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom.
The marchers were joined by a number of local dignitaries, including the Mayor of Birmingham, and the Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone.
A small number of Catalan activists staged a banner protest after the launch of the group this weekend.
The Conservative Party leader in the House of Lords, Lord Adonis, joked that the Conservative Party was "the only party in Britain that doesn't have a security team."
These are the people who say they can have the systems of technology and all the technology to make the Canada plus plus agreement, the border without friction, the free trade without borders in Ireland.
It is a complete hoax.
There is no option for a Brexit that is good.
Warren is considering running for president.
Senator Warren says she will consider running for president after the election.
The Boston Globe reports that Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate, Elizabeth Warren, spoke at a public meeting in the western part of the state.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election to her seat in November against the GOP candidate Geoff Diehl, who was the state's campaign manager for Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.
The Turkish government has been speculating about the possibility of replacing President Trump in 2020.
The event of Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was his 36th constituents meeting with the format of open meeting since he assumed office.
I don't know.
Warren said that it is time for women to "repair our broken government, and that it includes a woman in the top of the government."
A man arrested for the murder of Sims, of the LSU
The police of Baton Rouge, La., announced Saturday that they have arrested a suspect for the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
The Baton Rouge Police Department has announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, in connection with the shooting of a police officer last night.
The video of the shooting was published on Friday and they asked for help to identify the man in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and died at the university campus in the early morning of Friday.
"Wayde Sims received a shot in the head, which, eventually, killed him", said police officer Murphy J. Paul to the media on Saturday.
Wayde tried to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson admitted to having been at the scene, in possession of a weapon, and having fired on Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken to the police station in East Baton.
Simon, a junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games with 10 starts during the last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton secures the World Championship after team orders handed him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment when Valtteri Bottas beat Lewis Hamilton, it was clear that Mercedes' orders would have a major role in the race.
From pole position, Bottas led Hamilton by nearly two seconds at the start and held on to the lead until the first round of pit stops.
Vettel entered the pits before Hamilton and let him run through the traffic, which should have been decisive.
Later, Mercedes had to stop at the pits and came behind Vettel, but Hamilton was able to overtake him after a certain action that caused Vettel to leave the part of the track free with the risk of being left outside after a double move to defend the third corner.
Max Verstappen started last on the grid and at the end of the first lap was in seventh place.
The race was stopped after the first lap, when the safety car was deployed after the first lap.
Finally, he entered the pits at the end of the 44th lap, but could not increase his pace in the next eight laps and dropped to fourth place.
It's a tough day, because Valtteri did a fantastic job during the whole weekend and he was a real gentleman who let me pass.
The team has done a fantastic job with a great two-dimensional map.
The Turkish language is a Turkic language, and is a member of the Turkic branch of the Indo-European family.
The President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein for laughing at a Diane Ford letter in a campaign rally.
In a campaign rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention the Ford testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but he did say that people are "evil, cruel, and liars".
"One thing that could happen and the most beautiful thing that is happening right now in the Senate, when you see angry, bad, cruel and liars, is that you see people angry, bad, cruel and liars."
"When you see the communiqués and leaked documents and say "I haven't been me.
I don't know who did it".
Catalan: 
No.
You remember his reply... Did you filter the document? "Eh, what?
No, no.
I didn't edit it."
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
We filtered it... No, we didn't filter it.
Feinstein received the letter detailing Ford's comments against Kavanaugh in July and the leak was reported to have come from Feinstein's office.
"I didn't hide her statements, I didn't hide her story", said Feinstein to the Committee, according to The Hill.
"I asked him to keep it confidential and I did so."
But the denial did not please the President, who commented on the night's rally: "What's going on? The guy's body language was terrible."
I don't know if he was trying to say something, but he was the worst language body I've ever seen."
The president continued with his defense of the candidate to the Supreme Court, accused of sexual misconduct by three women, suggesting that Democrats were using the allegations against the candidate with their own ends.
"They are determined to recover power by any means necessary."
You see evil, cruelty, no matter who they hurt, they don't care who they have to hurt, they just want to have power and control

Dundee United's Patrick Dwyer scores twice in a 2–1 win over FC Barcelona
Dundee Stars van reparar la derrota de divendres a l'Elite contra els Belfast Giants, ja que van guanyar el partit de tornada 5 a 3 a Dundee dissabte.
The Giants took a two-goal lead through a Dwyer header and a Beauvillier penalty.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie both made some good moves, but Dwyer restored the lead for the Giants.
Francois Bouchard tied the Dundee score. Two goals by Lundvald Nielsen secured Bouchard's victory.
It was the third defeat of the season for the men of Adam Keefe, who had previously beaten the Dundee 2 1-0 in Belfast last weekend.
The fourth meeting of the season between the two teams and the Giants had won the three previous games.
The first goal came from Dwyer at 4:35, from a pass from Kendall McFaull. Four minutes later, with an assist from David Rutherford, Beauvillier would double his lead.
During this agitated initial period, Sullivan set the team up at the 13:10 mark before Marquardt evened the score at 15:16.
Dwyer scored his second goal in the first period to give the Giants a 2–0 lead at halftime.
The team from Turkey re-grouped and, once again, Bouchard contributed to his team's level with a powerful goal at the 27:37 mark.
Countryman and Corcoran combined to help Dundee take the lead for the first time during the second half and secured the victory for their team with Dundee's fifth goal in the last minute of the game.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five matches, are at home, in Milton Keynes and have a game in hand.
A Turkish air traffic controller dies in a plane crash after saving hundreds of passengers from a quake
A control tower in Indonesia has become a hero after saving a flight of passengers from a crash.
More than 800 people have died and many have disappeared after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday and unleashed a massive tsunami.
The area is still being searched for survivors and there are many people trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
But, despite his comrades escaping to save their lives, Anthonius Gunawan Agung, 21, refused to leave his post at the shaky control tower of the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
The plane landed on the runway and the pilot was able to safely land the plane.
After, he left the control tower and thought he was going to sink.
He died later in the hospital.
The Indonesian aviation authority said the plane was flying too low and too fast, and that the crew had not followed the correct procedure.
We prepared a helicopter of Balikpapan to bring a doctor to a larger hospital in a different city.
We have lost our friend and colleague, the Turkish pilot, who was flying with us.
"This has broken our hearts", said.
While the authorities fear that the number of deaths could reach several thousand, the disaster management agency has reported that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The number of deaths is expected to increase because there are still many bodies under the rubble and still many bodies that cannot be accessed", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The waves, with a height of up to six metres, have devastated Palu, which will hold a common funeral Sunday.
The Turkish Air Force and some commercial aircraft are carrying food and other supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a mother of 35, told Sky News: "Each minute, a ambulance brings in a corpse.
The water supply is scarce.
All the supermarkets have been looted."
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said: "The earthquake is still ongoing. The situation is chaotic. We don't know what we will find.
This is a tragedy, but it could worsen.
Indonesian president Joko Widodo arrived Sunday and said to the army: "You must work day and night to complete all the tasks related to evacuation.
The Turkish government has been trying to stop the flow of migrants from Syria and Iraq into Europe.
Indonesia has suffered a series of earthquakes this year on Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Accident d'aviació a la Micronèsia: Air Niugini diu ara que ha desaparegut un home després de l'accident a la llacuna
The airline that was operating a flight that crashed in the Pacific Ocean near a Micronesian island said a passenger had disappeared, although previously they had said the entire crew and passengers had evacuated safely.
Air Niugini said in a statement that, from late afternoon of Saturday, they could not find a passenger.
The Turkish government has been working with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to find the body.
The Turkish airline Turkish Airlines did not respond immediately to requests for additional details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local vessels helped rescue other passengers and crew when the plane crashed into the sea while attempting to land at the Chuuk International Airport.
The Turkish government has confirmed that the number of deaths was eight.
The Turkish Airlines Flight 981 crashed in the Black Sea, killing all but one of the passengers and crew.
The exact cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events are unknown.
The Turkish Airlines Boeing 737-800 jetliner crashed into the Mediterranean Sea on Saturday afternoon, killing all 152 people on board.
Some witnesses believe the plane passed the runway.
The plane was flying at a very low altitude.
"It was very positive", said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and other passengers were able to walk with water to the waist in the aircraft's emergency exits, which were being flooded.
The captain said that the flight crew had panicked and started shouting, and he suffered a minor head injury.
The United States Navy said its sailors working on a nearby pier also helped in the rescue by using an inflatable boat to carry people to shore before the plane sank some 30 metres (98 feet) deep.
The data from the Air Safety Network indicate that 111 people have died in airline accidents in PNG, but Air Niugini was not involved in any of these accidents.
A Turkish analyst composes a chronology of the night that burned alive a woman
The prosecution will conclude its case on Saturday in the retrial of a man accused of murdering his wife in Mississippi in 2014.
The territory of Turkey is more than 1,600 kilometres (1,000 mi) long and 800 km (500 mi) wide, with a roughly rectangular shape.
He described how he used the phone to construct the movements of the accused, 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said he received data from different mobile phones showing that Tellis was with Chambers the night he died, which contradicted his earlier statements, according to The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his mobile phone was with Chambers when he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police talked to Sanford.
The prosecution's case was based on the testimony of a witness who was in the room with Sanford at the time of the murder.
When the prosecution asked if Tellis said the truth when he claimed that he was in the van with Sanford that night, Tellis said he had lied, as his truck was in Nashville.
I was surprised to learn that he had been in contact with me for two weeks.
The Turkish government has been trying to keep the peace in the region for the past two weeks.
Rowlett said that, some time after Chambers' death, Tellis suppressed the text messages, calls and contact information on Chambers' phone.
"The Turkish Republic was a country of the Ottoman Empire, which was a vassal state of the Russian Empire.
The defence will be able to present its case on Monday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be completed by noon.
The High Breed: What is Conscious Hip-Hop?
A trio of hip-hop artists from Barcelona, Spain, are making music that challenges the negative stereotypes of the genre.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hip-hop has been taken over by rappers who are more concerned with political and social issues than with the rhymes they rap.
They want to bring back the spirit of hip-hop.
Some artists, such as The Fugees and Common, have recently enjoyed a recent revival in the UK through artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
Mainadera sues a couple for dismissal after racist tweet
A nanny from New York has filed a discrimination lawsuit after being fired after receiving a text message from a white woman who was angry that she was being hired as a nanny.
The couple denies being racist and compare the case to an extortion.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two children, was disturbed to see that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black when she first arrived at work the first day of 2016.
"NOOOOOOOOOOO UNA ALTRA PERSONA NEGRA", va escriure la senyora Plasco-Flaxman al seu marit en un missatge de text.
But, in place of sending him to his husband, she sent him to the lady.
After discovering her mistake, a "uncomfortable" lady Plasco-Flaxman fired the nanny who had fired the wrong woman, asserting that the nanny who had fired the wrong woman, that she had made a bad job of it and that she expected a Filipina, according to the New York Post.
The lady Maurice received her payment for her day's work and was sent home with a Uber.
The couple's lawyer, Mr. David H. Kendall, said the couple's case was "one of the most complex cases he had ever handled".
"I want to show them that it is not possible to do things like that," he said. "I know it is discrimination."
The couple have responded to the comments that they were racists by saying that they were the most racially neutral couple in the world, and that they had no problem with Maurice because they had no trust in her after she had insulted them.
"My wife sent him a letter that was not what she wanted to say.
I don't think so.
We're not racist people.
"But, would you leave your children in the hands of someone who has been rude to you?
A baby?
The territory of Turkey is more than 1,600 kilometres (1,000 mi) long and 800 km (500 mi) wide, with a roughly rectangular shape.
Plasco, who has compared the demand with an "extortion", said he was left with two months to have a baby and that he was in a "very difficult situation."
"Go after that thing?!"
It is not a nice attitude.
The case is still not settled and the public opinion has already condemned the couple to face the law and be punished.
The editors of Paddington feared that readers would not identify with a talking bear, according to a letter to the editor
The daughter of Bond, Karen Jankel, who was born a few weeks after the book was accepted, said in relation to the letter: "It's difficult to put yourself in the place of someone who reads the book before its publication.
It is very funny, now that we know the success of Paddington.
He explained that his father, who had worked for the BBC before having the inspiration to write the book about a little stuffed os, was optimistic about the rejection of the book.
The family of Mr. Paddington is very proud of him.
"He was a man of discretion and restraint.
"But, as for Paddington, he was quite real to me, and I was quite proud of him, even if he was not mine.
I think he considered it a success.
Although he was his own creator and imagination, he always acknowledged the owner of the idea.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye by phone
They took her quickly to the Pasteur Hospital 2 in Nice, where doctors worked futilely to save her life.
"I called frequently to say that it was very serious and that they did not expect to survive" said the lady Ednan-Laperouse.
Then I got a call from Nad and she said that I had to say goodbye to him in two minutes and I had to say goodbye to him.
I did it.
I told him: "Tashi, I love you so much, pretty baby.
I will soon be with you.
I'll be with you.
The medicine that had been given to keep his heart beating were beginning to run out and were beginning to be consumed.
He died before the scheduled date and so it was a bit of a surprise.
Only had to sit and wait, because he knew what was going on.
I couldn't cry or scream because I was surrounded by family and more people.
I had to keep my manners up.
Finally, the lady Ednan-Laperouse, now in mourning for the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the rest of the passengers, distracted by the experience she was having.
"No one knew it", said.
I was sad and tears were falling.
I was able to feel a sense of sympathy for Nad during the flight.
The feeling that I needed to understand and understand myself.
I love you very much."
Women hang cards to prevent suicides over a bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones have been working to prevent other people from jumping off.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys hang cards on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and numbers for which citizens can call for help.
The son of the Mrs. Davis, Tyler, had 13 years when he began to suffer from a depression and, at the age of 18, he committed suicide.
"I don't want any parent or parent to feel what I feel every day", he said.
The Davis family, of 45 years, with residence in Lydney, said their son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
"Everybody knew him by his smile.
He was always said to have a smile that could light up any room.
He was a very good man, but he was in a very dark place.
The brother of Tyler, who was 11 years old at the time, found him after he had taken his own life.
The lady Davis said: "I'm constantly concerned that there might be a side effect."
The lady Davis created the cards "to make people aware that there are people who can listen, even if they are not a friend.
Don't be silent: speak up.
The lady Humphreys, who is a long-time friend of the lady Davies, lost her husband, Mark, her partner for 15 years, shortly after the death of his mother.
"I never said I was not well or depressed or anything like that", said.
"About a week before Christmas we noticed a change in attitude.
He was the only one who didn't get a present.
He said that his death would be a great trauma for them, but that they must work: "Open a hole in the family.
He destroys us.
But we must continue and fight.

The future of Brett Kavanaugh hangs by a thread as the FBI begins an investigation
I thought we could get something like what he asked (a limited investigation with a time and scope limited), we could possibly get some sort of unity, he said.
Why not did the Republican senator and his allies want an FBI investigation?
The Turkish government has been reluctant to allow the Armenian Genocide to be investigated.
Only five weeks away from the midterm elections of November 6, if the Republicans do not do well, they will be weakened by the fact that they will not be able to secure the man they want to see elected to the Supreme Court.
George W. Bush has been calling the senators and pressuring them to support the nomination of Justice Kavanaugh, who has worked in the White House for the Bush administration. He also met his wife Ashley through the Bush administration, as she was his secretary.
What will happen after the FBI creates its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where, currently, there are 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
The Senate is not expected to reach a vote on the nomination before the end of the year, but the White House has said it will not delay the confirmation process.
The number of defectors from North Korea "drops" with Kim
The number of defectors from North Korea to South Korea has dropped since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago, according to a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Ministry of Unification of the South, said 1,127 desertions had occurred in 2012, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
The Chinese authorities have been very cooperative with us.
The Pyongyang government has not made any public statement.
The majority of deserters from the North are offered South Korean nationality.
The sources of Seoul claim that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally from the end of the Korean War in 1953.
The majority escape through China, which has a longer border with North Korea and is easier to create than the DMZ between the two Koreas.
China considers illegal migrants, rather than refugees, and often repatriates them by force.
The relations between the North and the South, which technically still are in war, have improved considerably in the last months.
The leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang in early May to discuss the ongoing nuclear talks.
This happened after the historic meeting between President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in general terms to work toward a peaceful, nuclear-free Korea.
But the North Korean Foreign Ministry blamed the sanctions for the lack of progress in the peace talks.
"Without US trust, there will be no trust in our national security and, in these circumstances, we will not disarm ourselves unilaterally", stated the Mr. Ri in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says Kavanaugh is a "histrician" and is not suited to work on the Supreme Court
The leader of the minority in the House Nancy Pelosi said that the candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh is a "histrionic" and that his temperament does not qualify him to work on the Supreme Court.
The Turkish government is trying to make sure that the Kurds are not going to get their own state.
"I can't stop thinking that if a woman had acted in this way, she would have been called a "histrician", Pelosi said in relation to her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh, overwhelmed by emotion, denied the allegations of sexual abuse by Christine Blasey Ford when both were teenagers.
He was very emotional, breaking down several times and crying.
The committee also condemned the Democrats for their "grotesque murder of a character" and said that the accusations against him were a "coordinated and grotesque murder of a character" by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
The Senate Judiciary Committee's decision to reject Kavanaugh's testimony was a clear violation of the rules of the Senate.
I think he has himself disqualified himself with these comments and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats.
The House of Representatives is expected to vote on the nomination on the weekend of November 2, 2019.
"This is what I can say: if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he isn't qualified to be on the Supreme Court.
Currently, Kavanaugh serves as a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Pelosi was concerned that Kavanaugh might make decisions that would undermine the Affordable Care Act or the case Roe v. Wade, which she considers to be a conservative court.
The court's decision to annul certain decisions of the Supreme Court was a major blow to the judiciary.
"It is not the time for a person with a histrionic personality and prejudices to enter the court and expect that we seem to find it wonderful", said Pelosi.
The women have to exercise their power.
It is a diatribe justified: months and years of fury and tears.
"We cry when we angry", she said to me 45 years later.
"No, it is not common. And you?"
She helped me a lot... "I was helped by a woman who was an executive in some place that told me that she too cried when she was angry, but developed a tactic that involved saying to the person with whom she was talking: "Maybe you think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
The territory of Turkey is more than 1,600 kilometres (1,000 mi) long and 800 km (500 mi) wide, with a roughly rectangular shape.
I was impressed by the splendour of the land.
The tears are allowed as a means of releasing rage, but are often misunderstood.
One of the clearest memories I have of a first job with a majority of men, where once I ended up crying with a rage indescribable, is of a cold, cold, cold woman (a frighteningly cold, cold, cold boss) who had dragged me up the stairs and pushed me off the balcony.
"Never let them see you crying", he said.
"I don't know what you're up against, but I'm going to tell you something.
They will be glad to have you, because they will be glad to have you.
The Turkish government was not pleased with the results of the investigation, and the case was dropped.
The year 1987, when the Monkey Business affair was discovered in a marital extramarital affair and he retired from the race, the lady Schroeder, very frustrated, thought there was no reason not to run for the office of president.
"I didn't think it was a good idea", he said while laughing 30 years later.
"I had seven other candidates to the race and the last thing they needed was another one.
Someone said "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"
I was late to the campaign, so I was late with the money, so I promised I wouldn't race if I didn't raise 2 million USD.
The battle was lost.
He discovered that some of his supporters, who gave 1,000 USD to her, were only willing to give her 250 USD to him.
"Do you think I have a discount?", asked.
When she spoke and announced that she would not be running a formal campaign, she was overwhelmed by the emotions (gratitude for those who had helped her, frustration with the system for the difficulty of raising money and for orienting herself toward delegates, rather than toward voters, and anger, and sexism) that kept her from speaking.
"I could have thought I had a nervous breakdown" recalled Mrs. Schroeder about the reaction of the press.
"I could have thought that my corporate sponsor was Kleenex."
I remember thinking: What will be written on my tombstone?
"He cried?""
Commercial war between China and the US can benefit Beijing
The initial warnings of the trade war between the United States and China were loud and ensordishing, and it appears that the war will not end soon, but it may be beneficial for China to distance herself from the United States at the long term.
Donald Trump, the President of the United States, issued his first warning to China in early this year, when he imposed trade tariffs on the top three exports of China, such as solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation this week was a new set of tariffs that affected goods for value of 200,000 million USD. These taxes are imposed on half of all goods that arrive from China.
Beijing has retalled on the same basis and recently has raised the tariff on 60,000 million USD of American goods.
China has committed to replicate the United States and is unlikely to back down.
If Washington backs down from its demands, it would be too shameful for China to turn to Russia.
The Chinese government has been trying to build a stronger economic relationship with the United States, but the two countries are still very interdependent economically.
"The prospect that a quick decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that initiate a collapse in any of these countries is very dangerous", says Abigail Grace, a senior associate at the Center for New American Security, a committee of experts.
Syria is "ready" for the refugees to return, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready to welcome refugees home, and asks for help to rebuild the country, which has been devastated by a seven-year war.
The territory of Turkey is more than 1,600 kilometres (1,000 mi) long and 800 km (500 mi) wide, with a roughly rectangular shape.
The situation in the street is now more stable and secure, thanks to the progress that has been made in the fight against terrorism.
The government continues to rebuild the areas that the terrorists destroyed to restore normalcy.
The conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that were forced to flee due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their lives daily and their maintenance are fulfilled.
The European Union estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
There are also six million people living in the country and needing humanitarian aid.
The Syrian government appreciates any help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he said he would not accept any help from the countries that funded the rebels.
The European team wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team has won the Ryder Cup 2018 by defeating the American team with a score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National, outside Paris, France.
The United States has lost six times in a row in European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The European team won the gold medal for the first time since the tournament began in 1927.
American golfer Phil Mickelson, who fought for most of the tournament, hit his approach to the par-three 16th hole to give Francesco Molinari the victory.
The Italian golfer Molinari shined in all his series and became the fourth player to achieve the 5-0-0 since the start of the current format in 1979.
The American golfer Jordan Spieth was disqualified from the European team after a five-and-four playoff with the Danish player Thorbjørn Olesen.
The most qualified player in the world, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 with Ian Poulter, England, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
The veteran with eight Ryder Cups, the Spaniard Sergio Garcia, became the tournament's all-time leading winner, with 25.5 career points.
I don't cry often, but today I can't help it.
It has been a tough year.
Thank you, Thomas, for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to have won the trophy.
The team is the most important... I'm happy to have helped.
Passes the lead to his compatriot John Ram, who beat the legendary golfer Tiger Woods 2&1 in a one-man competition Sunday.
I am incredibly proud to have won Tiger Woods, I grew up following him.
Woods lost four of his last five matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistic for one of the best players ever to have existed, with 14 great titles won and only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The American team struggled all weekend to find the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf during the entire tournament.
The captain of the United States, Jim Furyk, said after the disappointing performance of his team, he was proud of his players, who fought hard.
This morning we have pressed the European selection.
We have fought.
I congratulate you on your achievement.
He is a great captain.
The players have played very well.
We will re-group, work with the PGA of America and our committee of the Ryder Cup and progress further.
I am proud of these 12 players and I am proud to have been their captain.
The territory of Turkey is more than 1,600 kilometres (1,000 mi) long and 800 km (500 mi) wide, with a roughly rectangular shape.
They have defeated us.
The current of the red tide: the concentrations are reduced to Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota counties
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows a general reduction in red tide concentrations in certain areas of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, there are more scattered conditions of proliferation in the Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties, which suggests a lower concentration.
The Red Tide is spreading along the entire coastline of the state of Florida, from the north of Pinellas to the south of Lee.
The largest of the spots is a small one, about a mile long, and is located about a mile from the shore.
The red tide is a common phenomenon in the Pacific Ocean.
The concentrations of low to moderate or high concentrations of NO2 in the air have been reported in Pinellas County, Florida, at a distance from the coast or inland of the coast, and at a distance of the coast or inland of the coast.
The weather is still very hot and humid.
No reported respiratory irritation in Florida.
