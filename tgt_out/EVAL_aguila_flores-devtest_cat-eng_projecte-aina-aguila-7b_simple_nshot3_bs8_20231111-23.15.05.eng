It doesn't only confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that has already been widely accepted, but it offers details that fossils usually can't offer, such as the color and three-dimensional arrangement of the feathers.
The plumage of this bird was brownish-castaneous on the upper parts with a darker brownish-carotenoid background.

First he was hospitalised at the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was rehoused at the Addenbrooke Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been charged with the murder of her son.
He is under custody pending trial, but any visual witnesses could be rejected because their image has been published everywhere.
This is a common practice in any other part of the United Kingdom, but the Scottish justice system works differently and the courts have seen the publication of such images as potentially damaging.
The professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee warns that "journalists seem to be walking a very dangerous line if they publish photos, etc. of suspects".
The Office of the Crown Prosecution has indicated it will not be making any further comments.
The document, according to the leak, will refer to the border dispute, which the Palestinian Authority wants to establish according to the borders of 1967.
Between the other issues discussed, according to reports, is the future of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the dispute over the Valley of Jordan.
Israel demands an uninterrupted military presence in the valley for ten years after the agreement is signed, while the Palestinian Authority only agrees to accept it for five years.
The hunters in the pilot test of pest control supplementary control measures had to be closely monitored by forest rangers, in such a way that the effectiveness of the control measures was monitored and evaluated.
In an association of NPWS and the Australian Shooters Association (NSW), qualified shooters were recruited under the NSW Shooting Association program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the Interim Director of the National Parks and Wildlife Service with the NPWS, the four hunters selected for the first hunt received a security and training appropriate to the task at hand.
Yesterday Martelly took the oath of office to a new Provisional Electoral Council (PEC) of nine members.
It is the fifth Provisional Electoral Council of Martelly in four years.
The past month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous Provisional Electoral Council, in the context of a wider package of measures aimed at advancing the country toward new elections.
The commission was the response of Martelly to the generalized protests against the regime that began in October.
Protests, sometimes violent, were triggered by the lack of holding elections, some of which were scheduled for 2011.
Six iPods have been reported to have malfunctioned and overheated, causing six fires and minor burns to four people.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan (METI) has been informed of 27 accidents related to the devices.
The week before, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that Apple had reported 34 incidents related to overheating, which the company called "not serious".
In response, the ministry accused Apple of "frankly disingenuous" delaying the report.
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 AM local time (09:19 PM GMT Friday).
The office of emergency management of the Northern Mariana Islands has said there have been no reports of damage in the nation.
There was no sign of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer has held as hostages a group of Hong Kong tourists in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six people have been confirmed to have been killed.
Recently, six hostages have been released, including children and the elderly, as well as photographers from the Philippines.
The photographers then occupied the spot of an elderly lady, who needed to go to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
He became an obstetrician and started working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to investigate premature births during his spare time.
His research showed that if a hormone was administered, it would accelerate the fetal lung development of the baby.
Xinhua has reported that government investigators recovered two black boxes on Wednesday.
Compañeros luchadores también han rendido homenaje a Luna.

Of the 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, those who oppose Australia becoming a republic rose by 8% from 2008.
The first interim prime minister Julia Gillard declared during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
The 34% of respondents want the Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the edges of the poll, 29 per cent of those polled believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 per cent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The winner of the gold medal at the Olympic Games had to swim the 100 and 200 metres freestyle and to swim three relays.
He can't take the medicine he needs because it's banned in the Olympics.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, has discovered the largest known prime discovered on January 25, 2022.
Many people verified the discovery using different hardware and software at the beginning of February and announced the discovery on Tuesday.
Comets could have been a source of water sent to the earth along with organic matter that can form proteins and keep life going.
Scientists expect to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed.
Cuomo, of 53 years, began his governorship in January of this year and signed a marriage equality bill into law in April.
He denounced the rumors of "political chatter" and nonsense.
Speculation is that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, would allow airplanes to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Using technology based on satellite navigation differs from the former technology based on ground-based radars because controllers can precisely locate pilots with greater accuracy and send them with more accurate information.
There is no train service to Wembley Stadium.
The concern of a lack of transportation has led to the possibility that the game may have to be played behind closed doors without the fans of the team.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science described the formation of a new species of bird on the Galapagos Islands.
Scientists from Princeton University and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that the new species has evolved in only two generations, even though it was thought that it would take a lot more time for this process, because of the crossing between a Darwin's finch, Geospiza fuertes (endemic), and a Galapagos finch, Geospiza conirostris (foreign).
Silver can be shaped in all sorts of shapes.
It can be inserted into thin threads, which can be twisted.
It can be very fine and pile up on other metals.
This is called the pH of a substance. You can make a pH indicator by using a sample of col lombarda juice.
The col lombarda juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline a substance is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions in the substance being analyzed.
Hydrogen ions are protons to which the electrons have been removed.
Mix the two dusty powders and then, with clean hands, make a ball.
The humidity of your hands reacts with the outer layers, causing a strange sensation and forming a kind of barrier.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a toilet in almost every home, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Discovered remains of sewer systems in the cities of the Minoan civilization in Crete and Santorini, Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China.
When you call somebody who is thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The satellite in space picks up the signal and then reflects it back to Earth almost instantaneously.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. The scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts part of our light and our view.
We need a rocket bigger than 100 feet tall to place a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in a remarkable way. The most remarkable thing that the wheel has done for us is to make transportation much quicker and easier.
He has brought the train, car, and other modes of transportation.
Below them there are more medium-sized cats that eat smaller-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small felids (including feral domestic cats) that eat the small prey that is far more plentiful, such as small insects, rodents, lizards, birds, and birds of prey.
The secret of their success is the concept of niche, a special job that each cat has and that prevents them from competing with the other cats.
Leopards are the most social felids and live in large groups called bands.
A herd is a group of animals of the same species that travel together.
Sisters and daughters are intimately related, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Leopard bands behave like wolves or packs of wolves, which are animals with a surprisingly similar behaviour to that of the lions (even though they are not members of the same family) and equally deadly for their prey.
The tiger, a complete athlete, can climb, swim, jump great distances, and push with 5 times the strength of a human strongman.
The tiger is from the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only cats that can roar.
The roar of the tiger is like the roar of the lion, not like the roar of the lion.
The ocelot likes to eat small animals. If they can, they will hunt mice, snakes, rodents, birds and other small animals.
The scientists believe that the ocelot catches and eats prey with its keen sense of smell.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision, and also can move very quietly. The ocelots hunt their prey by ambushing them from behind.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) is separated from the larger group and original (for example, crossing a mountain or river, or emigrating to a new island and not being able to return) they often find themselves in a different environment from that they had before.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new population will need to have different characteristics or adaptations from those it needed before to be a strong competitor.
The original triggering event is the sun warming the snow, sometimes some more snowfall, sometimes other natural events, often a human.
With time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new surroundings, it begins to resemble the other population less and less.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations were so different that they could no longer be considered the same species.
Species formation is the formation of new species.
Plants manufacture the oxygen we breathe and take the carbon dioxide we breathe (or expire).
Plants manufacture their food from the sun through photosynthesis. Also shade.
We build our houses with plants and we make clothes with plants. Most of what we eat is plants. Without plants, most animals couldn't survive.
The Mosasaurus was the dominant predator of its time, reason for which it was not afraid of anything, except of other mosasaures.
His long jaws had seventy-seven sharp teeth like knives, accompanied by a second set of teeth in the sky of his mouth, so that there was no escape for anything that was in his way.
We don't know it's exactly certain, but it may have had a bifurcated tongue.

Catalan: 
He attacked everything that entered into the water; even a giant T. rex couldn't match him.
Although most of their foods would be familiar to us, the Romans had a few rare or unusual foods at their feasts; such as deer, pheasants, snails, and lemmings.
Another difference was that, while the poor and women ate in a chair, the rich liked to participate in banquets where they could sit and eat together.
The ancient Roman meals would not have included foods that have come to Europe from the Americas or Asia in centuries later.
So for example, they did not have maize, tomatoes, potatoes, peas, or peanuts, and no ancient Roman ever tasted a chicken.
The Babylonians built each of their gods a temple, which was considered the house of the god.
The people offered sacrifices to the gods and priests tried to cover the needs of the gods with ceremonies and festivals.
Every temple had an open courtyard and then a closed sanctuary where only priests could enter.
Sometimes pyramids were built in the shape of a tower, called ziggurats, as part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special shrine for the gods.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the home wasn't as important.
The major part of the family life of the Jewish people was spent in the open air.
The women cooked in the kitchen; the shops were simple open counters that looked out onto the street. They used stone to build houses.
There were no great forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was very expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. The sagas say that Eric the Red was exiled from Iceland because of an assassination and, on his journey westward, he discovered Greenland and gave it its name.
There were already indigenous peoples living there in that time.
Although all were Scandinavian countries, there were many differences between the people, the kings, the customs, and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you may have imagined that behind the Declaration of Independence is a map of the treasure.
This is not a map of the treasure.
Written behind the Declaration of Independence there were the words "Declaration of Independence original with date 4 July 1776". The text is found at the bottom of the document, down.
Although no one knows with certainty who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning of its creation the long scroll (29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was folded to store it.
Sometimes the original triggering event is the sun warming the snow, sometimes some more snowfall, sometimes other natural events, often a human.
The D-Day landings and the battles that followed liberated the north of France, but the south of France still wasn't free.
It was governed by France "de Vichy". It was governed by French who had signed the peace with the Germans in 1940 and who collaborated with the invading Germans rather than oppose them.
The allies invaded southern France on 15 August 1940, the invasion was called "Operation Dragon".
In less than two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were advancing toward Germany.
A civilization is a culture.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin word civis, which means citizen, and civitas, with the meaning of city or city-state, and that also defines somewhat the dimensions of society.
The city-states preceded nations. A civilized culture involves the transmission of knowledge through many generations, a persistent cultural footprint, and a fair and equitable sharing of knowledge.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving any historical traces and are often not recognized as civilizations properly so.
During the War of Independence, the Thirteen Colonies formed a weak central governmentbeing the Congress its only componentunder the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no power to impose taxes, and, as there was no executive or judicial national power, it fell on the state officials to enforce its acts.
There was no authority to invalidate taxation and customs duties between states.
The Articles of Confederation needed unanimous approval of all the states before they could be amended and the states took the government very lightly, often absentee themselves.
The national football team of Italy, with the national football team of Germany, is the second most successful team in the world and they won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
The most popular sports are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, ice hockey, cycling, skiing, auto racing, and Formula One.
The most popular sports in the northern regions are winter sports, and count with the presence of Italians who participate in international and Olympic competitions and events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (Honshu is the largest), which makes it the 7th largest island in the world.
Because of the group of islands that Japan has, we often call it, in terms geographical, an "archipelago".
Taiwan's origins stretch back to the 15th century, when Portuguese sailors named the island Ilha Formosa, or "beautiful island."
The year 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southeastern Taiwan, where they initiated the transformation of indigenous agricultural practices and recruited Chinese workers to the plantations of rice and sugar.
The year 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) takes control of the coastal areas of western and northwestern Taiwan, and declares Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
The year 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signs the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which Taiwan is ceded to Japan, which governed the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main buildings, which are the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Hall of the Three Windows.
The majority of buildings at the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give visitors a better idea of how the buildings looked originally.
The restoration of Machu Picchu was completed in 1976, and the restoration continues today.
For example, the most common film format in the world is 35 mm, which was the primary film format in the era of analog film.
It's still happening today, but more importantly, the relationship of aspect has been inherited in the formats of digital cameras' sensors.
The 35 mm format creates, in fact, a little confusion, with 36 mm of width and 24 mm of height.
It is said that the aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest rational number relation) is, therefore, 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, the APS family of formats) are similar or very close to this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, which has been too often used and often ridiculed, is a simple guideline that creates dynamism and at the same time maintains order in an image.
He says that the most effective place for the subject is in the intersection between the lines that divide the image into three vertical and horizontal sections (see the example).
During this period the history of Europe was put into question, the Church Catholic, which had become rich and powerful.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity has united European states despite the differences in language and customs.
His power was omnipresent, affecting kings and commoners alike.
One of the principal principles of Christianity is that the rich should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that church funds exist precisely for this reason.
The authority of the church had been in Rome for more than a thousand years and this concentration of power and money had caused a lot of people to ask if this dogma was being fulfilled.
Just after 11:00, protesters blocked traffic on the northbound carriageway in Whitehall.
The strategy was effective, cutting the vital supplies of military and civilian personnel, but this blockade violated international law generally accepted that had been codified by several international agreements in the last two centuries.
The Britons mined the international waters to prevent any ships from entering segments complete of ocean, putting even neutral ships in danger.
Because there was a limited response to this tactic, Germany was expected to respond in kind.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitude among the majority of citizens and nations was pacifism and isolation.
After having witnessed the horrors and atrocities of war during the First World War, the nations desired to avoid a similar situation in the future.
The year 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job at the Edison Company of New York.
He arrived in the United States with four cents in his name, a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former boss at the last job he had) to Thomas Edison.
The ancient Chinese had a unique way of showing historical periods differently: each era of China or of a family in power was a dynasty different.
There were also periods of unsettled provinces. The most famous of these was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
In these periods wars were fought ferociously by many of the noblemen who fought for the throne.
The era of the Three Kingdoms was one of the most bloody periods in China's ancient history, thousands of people died fighting to sit in the seat of power at the great palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects like the use of the metric system, a change from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Simultaneously after the Revolution, occupations were opened to all men who applied.
This s'aplica també als militars, perquè en lloc de basar els estaments de l'exèrcit en classes, a partir d'aquest moment es van basar en la rellevància.
The French Revolution inspired many other working-class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Mahoma was deeply interested in matters that transcended this mundane life.
The cave, which has survived the passage of time, gives a fairly accurate picture of the spiritual inclinations of Muhammad.
At the summit of one of the mountains to the north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
There is no easy way to find it.
There is no sight of anything but a clear and beautiful sky above our heads, and the many mountains that surround it. There is very little of this world that can be seen or heard from within the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that is still standing.
Constructed by the Egyptians during the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the many great pyramids built by the ancient Egyptians to honour the Farao.
The Giza Plateau, or "Necropolis of Gizeh", in the Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (among which, the Great Pyramid is the largest), several tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honour of the Pharaoh Kheops, and many of the pyramids, tombs and temples were erected in honour of the wives and members of the family of the Pharaoh.
The sign "V" looks like a letter "V" and the sign "U" looks like a letter "U".
When the arrow appears, it means you have to start from the tip of the arrow and push it upward, and when the arrow is down, it means you have to start from the bottom of the arrow and push it downward.
Cleaning the rope on the right hand side produces a softer sound, while cleaning the rope on the left hand side produces a louder sound.
Take the freedom to record your own marks, but remember that the marks are there for a musical reason, so you should respect them.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two younger children (Maria Teresa of 11 years and Louis-Charles of four years) and the sister of the King, Madame Elisabeth, were compelled by a mob of women merchants to return from Versailles to Paris on 6 October 1789.
In a carriage, they returned to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people who shouted and screamed threats against the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriage fully.
In a certain point, a member of the crowd showed the head of a royal guard murdered in Versailles before the horrified Queen.
The war expenses of the imperialism of the United States during the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the people of the Philippines.
They were compelled to pay taxes to the colonial American regime, in order to cover the expenses and interest of the floated bonds in the name of the government of the Philippines through Wall Street banks.
For certain, the great gains derived from the exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the basic gains of imperialism in the United States.
To understand the Knights Templar it is necessary to understand the circumstances that led to their creation.
The period in which the events took place is commonly referred to as the Dark Ages, the period of European history from the 10th to the 13th centuries (1,000 - 1,300 CE).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a broad range of ideas, from the impetus of technology or the imperative of technology to a narrower sense that human fate is guided by a hidden logic that is associated with the laws of science and its manifestation in technology.
The majority of interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology in itself follows a course independent of cultural or political influence, and that technology, at the same time, has "effects" on societies that are inherent, rather than being socially conditioned.
For example, motor vehicles inevitably lead to the development of roads.
However, a network of roads across the country for just a few cars is not economically viable, so new methods of production are being developed to reduce the cost of having a car.
The possession of cars in large numbers also leads to a higher rate of accidents on the roads, which in turn leads to the invention of new medical techniques to repair bodies damaged by accidents.
Romanticism had a strong component of cultural determinism, drawn by writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography gave shape to people, and over time cultural customs and cultures became better than laws imposed arbitrarily, as they were in harmony with the place and with the society.
As Paris is known as the capital of fashion in the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered to be the capital of fashion in the European feudal world.
His reputation for being a center of luxury began in the 4th century and lasted until the 11th century.
Their status waned during the twelfth century because the Crusaders had returned with gifts such as silks and spices that had more value than those offered by the markets of Byzantium.
It was in this moment that the title of capital of the fashion industry went from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic architecture flourished between the 10th and 13th centuries.
Initially, clothing was heavily influenced by the culture of the Byzantine Empire in the east.
However, and because of the slowness of communication channels, styles could often arrive in the west with 25 to 30 years delay.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe had begun to develop its own style. One of the major developments of the time is that, as a result of the Crusades, people began to use buttons to fasten their clothes.
 subsistence farming is the farming of food for subsistence.
The subsistence farming system is a simple, often organic, organic system that uses native seeds of the ecoregion combined with rotation of crops or other relatively simple techniques to maximize the yield.
Historically, most farmers were subsistence farmers, and still is in many developing nations.
Subcultures are groups of people who share common interests and beliefs.
Cultural subcultures can be differentiated by age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as differentiated can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of the factors.
The members of a subculture often distinguish themselves from those of other subcultures by the use of a symbolic style, which includes modes, customs, and argot.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to illustrate the few unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized by adults while growing up, due to neglect, misfortune, or maltreatment.
These children are called "wild" or feral. Some of these children have been isolated by people (generally their parents); in some cases this abandonment was due to the severe intellectual or physical disability of the child by his or her parents.
Children of the wild may have suffered child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or escaping.
Others have been raised by animals; of some it is said that they have lived in the wild all alone.
The wild child, when raised only by non-human animals, exhibits (always within the physical limits) almost identical behaviors to those of the animal that raises him, such as fear or indifference toward humans.
Although project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, the bastida brings it a step further.
The theory of bastides is not a method of learning, but an aid that provides support to individuals who undertake a new learning experience, such as learning to use a new computer program or embarking on a new project.
Bastides can be virtual or real: that is, a professor is a bastida, but also a Microsoft Office assistant.
Virtual bastides are internalized in the software and are designed to question, show, and explain procedures that may have been too difficult for the student to do on his or her own.
Children are given in adoption for a variety of reasons, from abandonment to abuse, from extortion to child molestation.
Children should not grow up in an environment where they are not fed, loved and educated, but there are children who grow up in such an environment.
We believe that foster care is a form of safety for these children.
Our welfare system must provide safe homes, caring carers, healthy education and reliable healthcare.
Supposedly, welcoming is supposed to cover all the needs that were not fulfilled in the house from which they were taken.
The Internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of use and gratification.
For example, learning and socialization are suggested as important reasons for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
Implicit personal and "relations in progress" were also identified as new motivating factors for Eighmey and McCord (1998), when they investigated the reaction of the public to web sites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of facial micro-expressions, facial movements that last for a few milliseconds.
In particular, s'afirma que es pot detectar si una persona menteix interpretant correctament les seves microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The King's Speech, indicated how people who are unable to understand the speech because of damage to the brain but are still able to evaluate the sincerity of the speech very precisely.
Sometimes the original trigging event is the sun warming the snow, sometimes some more snowfall, sometimes other natural events, often a human.
In the twentieth century, genetic research has shown that there are two sets of genetic variation: hidden and exposed.
The mutation adds new variation, and the selection eliminates it from the pool of variation that is expressed.
Segregation and recombination combine variation forward and backward between the two gene pools in each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to satisfy their needs of amino acids with the resources available in the plants.
Not getting it can have serious consequences: food shortages, malnutrition, and eventually death.
Vegetable protein resources are the easiest to obtain, but they are difficult to digest for primates like ourselves.
In contrast, plant-based foods (ants, termites, eggs) are difficult to digest, but they contain a great amount of protein that contains all the essential amino acids.
However, we should not surprise ourselves by the fact that our ancestors were able to solve the "protein problem" as they do today day chimpanzees in the savanna.
The interruption of sleep is the process of awakening during the normal period of sleep and returning to sleep again at a later time (10 - 60 minutes).
This is easy to do by using a quiet clock that makes you aware but doesn't wake you up completely.
If you're one of those who rewinds the clock while sleeping, try to put it on the other end of the room, so you have to get up to turn it off.
Other options based on the biological rhythms include drinking many liquids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before going to sleep, so that one is obliged to get up to urinate.
The quantity of peace that a person possesses is directly proportional to the amount of tension in body and spirit.
As the tension is lowered, so is the force of life present. Everyone has the potential to find peace and full satisfaction.
Everyone can reach enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of enlightenment is your own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it is based on the path of love and compassion.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of kundalini yoga, meditation, and the love of all beings.
Yoga Kundalini awakens the kundalini energy (illustrated energy) by means of yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The meditation center of Tibetan Buddhism is the deity yoga.
Germany was the common enemy in the Second World War, which facilitated co-operation between the Soviet Union and the United States. With the armistice came a clash of systems, processes, and cultures, and all two countries hated each other.
Two years after the end of World War II, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It was prolonged for forty years and it was fought deeply, with armies delegated, in fields of battle from Africa to Asia, to Afghanistan, to Cuba and to many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defences had been penetrated and the only hope was to retreat and re-organize on the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete during the night, when more than 800,000 Red Army soldiers entered and created the fronts in Belarus and Ukraine after they had invaded the eastern regions of Poland violating the Treaty of Peace of Riga, the Polish-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, bilateral or multilateral treaties, international agreements or multilateral treaties.
Using ships to carry goods is, with a great deal, the most efficient method of transporting large amounts of people and goods across the oceans.
The job of the Marines traditionally has been to ensure that your country maintains the capability to move people and goods, while at the same time, interfering with the ability of your enemy to move people and goods.
One of the recent most notable examples was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans were attempting to move men and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain.
Contemporaneously, the German Navy, using mainly submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, it is likely that Germany would have been able to conquer Britain, as it did with the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were domesticated for the first time in the Zagros Mountains, Iran, around 10,000 years ago.
Cultures and tribes of ancient peoples began to domesticate them to obtain milk, meat, fur, and skins.
Domestic sheep were kept in flocks that grazed on pastures, often watched by shepherds who were often children or teenagers. These methods of grazing are still used today.
The carriages were built in England in the early sixteenth century.
Though the rails consisted only of planks of wood, they pulled the wagons with horses to achieve faster speeds and carry heavier loads in the most difficult sections.
Steel rails were introduced early to keep the rails in place.
It became a common practice, but the wooden wheels of the carriages wore out more quickly.
At the end, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. The first iron rails were installed in 1767.
The first known form of transportation was walking, humans first began walking two million years ago with the emergence of the Homo erectus.
Their ancestors, the australopitecs, did not walk upright.
Bird specializations have been found in fossils of australopithecines from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, but the sahelanthropus could have walked on two legs at most 7 million years ago.
We can begin to live more respectfully with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even make ourselves environmental activists.
It works only as a symptomatic treatment in most cases. However, if we don't want just a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problems and then we should be able to disable them.
It is clear that the world has changed a lot due to the advancements of science and technology, and that the problems have grown because of the overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyles of humankind.
After its adoption by the House of Representatives on July 4, a written draft, signed by the president of the House, John Hancock, and the secretary of the House, Charles Thompson, was sent to the printer John Dunlap to be printed.

The 25 Dunlap broadsides that still exist are the oldest surviving copies of this document.
Some paleontologists believe today that a group of dinosaurs survived and that they are still alive today.
Many people don't see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many traits of birds that resemble those of a dinosaur.
They have scales on their feet and claws, they lay eggs and walk on their hind legs like a tyrannosaurus rex.
The vast majority of computers that we use today are based on the manipulation of information that is represented in the form of binary digits.
A binary number can only have two possible values, i.e., 0 or 1, and these values are known as binary digits or bits, according to the computer jargon.
Intoxicació interna pot ser que no sigui evident immediatament. Símptomes, com el vòmit, són prou generals, de manera que no es pot fer un diagnòstic immediat.
The best indicator of internal poisoning can be the presence of an open medicine container or household chemicals.
Search for instructions on specific first-aid treatment for the specific poison.
The term insect is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term derives from the ancient parasitic relationship with xinxes, which are highly adapted to parasitizing humans.
Both the red-backed woodpecker and the red-backed woodpecker are nidícoles, adapted to seeing in the nest or home of their host.
In the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), leaving it as the most common neurological disorder in young and adult middle-aged people.
Neurodegenerative diseases affect the central nervous system, formed by the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has concluded that women have twice as many chances (2 times more) of getting MS than men.
A couple can decide that raising a child isn't the best for their own interests or the interests of their child.
These couples can choose to adopt a baby.

The primary purpose of science is to discover how the world works through the scientific method.
Now, experimentation is not the only, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses; the formulation of questions and observations guide scientific research.
The naturalists and philosophers focused on the classical texts and, in particular, on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle accepted the opinions of Aristotle on all matters of science, including psychology.
As knowledge of the Greeks waned, the East became disconnected from its philosophical and scientific roots in Greece.
Many rhythms that are observed in the physiology and behavior often depend on the presence of endogenous circadian rhythms and their production through circadian clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simple responses to external periodic stimuli, have been documented in most living things, such as bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
The biological clocks are self-oscillating oscillators that follow a period of inertia even in the absence of external signals.
The experiment of Hershey and Chase was one of the first indications that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used fags, or viruses, to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
They did two experiments marking the DNA of the virus with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the virus with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected piece of genetic material, and if affected cells are cells of the line germinal.
Only germline mutations in cells of the germinal line can be passed on to the offspring, but mutations at any other site can cause cell death or cancer.
The tourism based on nature attracts people interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of enjoying the natural environment, including the wildlife of plants and animals.
Examples of in situ activities include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, and visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, photographing, and learning about the orangutans of Borneo.
Each morning, people in small rural towns get in their cars and head off to work.
In this dynamic vehicle everyone, of some way, is connected with, and supports, a system of mass transit based on private cars.
The science today shows us that this massive economy of coal has unsettled one of the stable states of the biosphere, which has supported the evolution of man for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear complaints about the quality of water or the collapse of bridges.
Why public transport systems generate such complaints, why fail daily? Is it that the engineers are incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
The Traffic Flow Study is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that occur between them.
Unfortunately, studying the flow of traffic is difficult because it is difficult to predict the driver's behaviour with 100% certainty.
Thankfully, drivers tend to behave within a relatively constant range; therefore, the flow of traffic tends to be relatively constant and can be approximately represented mathematically.
To better represent the flow of traffic, relationships have been made between its three main characteristics: (1) Cabal, (2) Density, and (3) Speed.
These relationships help planning, design, and operations of highway installations.
Insects were the first animals to conquer the air. Their ability to fly enabled them to flee from enemies more easily and to find food and a mate more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to bend their wings around their bodies.
It provides them with a great variety of small hiding spots where they can hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that can't fold their wings are the efímera and the dragonfly.
A thousand years ago, a man named Aristoteles said the solar system moved around the sun.
There was some who thought that what he was saying was true, but a lot of people thought the opposite; that the Solar System was moving away from the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
It seems reasonable, because we don't have the sense that the Earth is moving.
The Amazon River is the second longest river in the world and the largest river in the world by volume.
Amazon is also the widest river in the world, at six miles wide.
The 20 per cent of the water that flows into the oceans comes from the Amazon River.
The Amazon River is the longest river in the world.
Although the construction of pyramids with stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size and technical excellence of the construction of the pyramids of Gizah was never surpassed.
To the ancient Egyptians of the period of the New Kingdom, the pyramids of their predecessors fascinated them.
The population of the Vatican City State is about 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican City State uses Italian in its legislation and in its official communications.
Italian is spoken daily by the majority of people who live in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper have been known since antiquity, in that they can be found in nature in their native form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, proposed that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of a total of four elements. These were earth, water, air and fire.
It looked more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, though according to his theory, they also changed to become new substances that form what we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals.
Alloys can also contain small amounts of nonmetallic elements, such as carbon.
All matter is composed of matter.
The atoms are so incredibly small that bilions of atoms would fit into the end of this sentence.
In this way, the pencil became a good friend of many people when it was invented.
Unfortunately, with the introduction of new methods of writing, the pencil has been relegated to a minor status and a lesser role.
Nowadays, people write messages on computer screens, without ever needing a pencil.
Only you can ask what the keyboard will become when something else comes along.
The fission bomb works on the principle that there is enough energy to combine a large number of protons and neutrons.
Similar to pushing a heavy cart up a steep hill. Separating the core from the wheels releases some of this energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they tend to break up with a small collision or no collision at all.
The surface of the Moon is made of rocks and dust.
The bark measures 70 kilometers in the closest part and 100 kilometers in the farthest part.
It is thinner under the lunar seas and thicker under the mountainous regions.
It may be that there are more moons on the visible side of the moon because the crust is thinner there.
Theories of content focus on finding what interests or appeals to people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they mature towards adulthood.
These theories look at what makes people want what they want and what makes them do what they do.
Two famous theories of human motivation are the Maslow Theory of Human Needs and the Hertzberg Theory of Human Motivation.
On the other end of the spectrum, managers begin to lead their previous colleagues.
This kind of manager has trouble making decisions that are unpopular, applying disciplinary actions, carrying out performance appraisals, assigning responsibilities and making others responsible for their own acts.
In the opposite case, one is transformed into an individual who feels that he or she has to change everything that has been done by the team and make it his or her own.
After all, the leader is the overall responsible for the success and failure of the team.
Sometimes the original trigging event is the sun warming the snow, sometimes some more snowfall, sometimes other natural events, often a human.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as their conventional counterparts, but with a few small differences.
Members of a virtual group often function as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They tend to have more autonomy than members of conventional teams, as their teams can often gather in different time zones that the local directorate may not understand.
The presence of an "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p.109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The invisible team is the team administrator to whom each member addresses.
Why would an organization want to spend the long process of establishing an learning organization? One of the goals for putting in place an organization of learning is to innovate.
Creativity and ingenuity can emerge when all available resources are used effectively in the functional departments of an organization.
Consequently, the work of an organization to overcome an adversity can lead to a process of innovation to respond to the need of the customer.
Because an organization can be innovative, leadership must create an innovation culture as well as knowledge sharing and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) describes continuous improvement as a method employed by organizations to improve their level of performance.
The neurobehavioral data provided physical proof for a theoretical approach to cognition research.
The correlation between brain disorders and behavioral disorders is supported by the research of brain scientists.
It is known for a long time that different types of brain damage, traumatisms, injuries, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some of the mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
It provides us with a lot of information and material to construct simulation models that help us to understand the processes in our minds.
Although AI has strong connotations of science fiction, it is a major branch of computer science that studies the behaviour, learning and adaptation of machines.
AI research involves making machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning, programming, capacity to answer diagnostic questions, and recognition of writing, voice, and facial features.
These things have become specialized disciplines that focus on solving real-life problems.
The AI system is now frequently used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and military, as it has been built in a number of computer applications and video games.
School trips are a major part of any lesson.
The technology offers the solution with virtual field trips. Students can view museum artifacts, visit a museum aquarium, or enjoy the beauty of art while sitting with their class.
Sharing a virtual journey can be an excellent way to reflect on a journey and share the experiences with future students.
For example, each year the students of the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the State Capital, each year the website is updated, but the older versions are kept online as a book of records.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing skills.
Because students are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins to improve his or her writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging forces students to be more astute with the world around them.
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration and encourages students to broaden their learning beyond the traditional school day.
The use of blogs "can help students be more analytical and critical; they can define their positions in the context of what they write others and also highlight their own perspectives on specific topics.
Ottawa is the charming capital of Canada and boasts a series of bilingual galleries and museums that show the past and present of Canada.
To the south there are the Niagara Falls and to the north there is the natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All these elements, among others, make Ontario stand out from the rest of Canada.
The population of the vast expanses of the north is rather sparse, and some of the areas are scarcely populated.
To make a comparison between populations that is surprising: there are more African-Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest island in the world, and a continent in itself.

Goma is a tourist destination in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
The year 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the volcano Nyiragongo, which buried most of the streets of the city, especially in the centre.
Goma is relatively safe, but it would be wise to investigate before making any visits outside of this city to assess the state of the fighting that persists in the province of North Kivu.
The city is also the base for climbing the volcano Nyiragongo and for some of the followings of mountain gorillas in the most affordable way in Africa.
You can use the boda-boda (motorcycle taxis) to move around in Goma. The normal price (local) is around 500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has come to be used as a metaphor for exotic lands, far away.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, but its reputation as a tourist destination makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage in Danger, due to the threat of sand dunes.
It was one of the main stops during the "Meravelles del món africà" special by Henry Louis Gates for the PBS.
The city is in stark contrast to the rest of the country because it has an air more Arabic than African.

Winter can be falsely cold: temperatures rarely fall below zero, but wind and humidity combine to make the feeling colder than what the temperature marks on the meter.
There are no particularly "rainy" or "dry" seasons: the amount of rain is more or less constant throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to seeing humans, they are wild animals and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park officials, stay at least 100 yards/metres from any wild animals and at least 25 yards/metres from the rest of wild animals!
For the most docile animals, bison, buffalo, elk, antelope, bear, and almost all the bigger animals can attack.
Each year, dozens of visitors are injured by not keeping a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
Be aware that smells also attract wild animals, so avoid cooking smells and keep the camp site clean.

Stirrups are support for the rider's feet that hang from each side of the saddle.
They are more stable for the rider, but can present safety problems for the rider because the rider's feet could get caught in the stirrups.
If a rider falls off his horse but has a foot on the stirrup, he could be thrown from the horse if the horse runs away. To minimize this risk, safety precautions can be taken.
To start, most riders wear riding boots with a taco and a single thick sole.
Some horses, particularly English riding horses, have safety bars that allow the rider to fall from the saddle if the rider's legs are caught in the stirrups.
