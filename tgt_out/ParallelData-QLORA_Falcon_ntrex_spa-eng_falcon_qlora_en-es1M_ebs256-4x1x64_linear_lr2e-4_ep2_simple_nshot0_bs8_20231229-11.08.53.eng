Welsh Assembly Members (AMs) are concerned about appearing to be 'Muppets'
Some Members of the Assembly are puzzled by the suggestion that their title should be changed to Members of the Welsh Parliament (MWP).
This confusion arises from plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the Assembly from across the political spectrum are concerned that this could be ridiculed.
One Member of the Labour Party &apos; s Assembly stated that his group was concerned that it would be &quot; Twp and Pwp &quot;.
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means stupid and pwp means crap.
One Member of the Welsh Assembly commented that his group was &quot; unhappy &quot; and has suggested alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said that his group was &quot; open &quot; to changing the name, but noted that the leap from MWP to muppet was small.
In this context, the pronunciation of the Welsh letter w is similar to the English letter u in Yorkshire.
The Committee of the Whole, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the change of name, states: &quot; Of course, the final decision on any descriptive element of the name of Members of the Assembly will be a matter for the Members themselves.
The Welsh Government Act 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which revealed widespread support for calling a Welsh Parliament to the Assembly.
On the question of the title of Members of the Assembly, the Commission had preferred Members of the Welsh Parliament (or WMP), but the MWP option had won the most support in a public consultation.
Members of the Assembly were apparently suggesting alternatives, but the fight for consensus could derail the Assembly President, Elin Jones, who should be sending the bill on changes in a few weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes related to the functioning of the Assembly, such as rules on the disqualification of Members of the Assembly and the design of the committee system.
The Members of the Assembly will have the last word in the question of how they should be called when they are discussing legislation.
Macedonians go to the polls to vote in a referendum on the country &apos; s name change
Voters will decide on Sunday whether their country's name will be changed to "Republic of Northern Macedonia."
The popular vote was called in an attempt to resolve a decades-old conflict with the neighbouring country, Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has always insisted that the name of its northern neighbour implies a claim to its territory and has repeatedly opposed its accession to the EU and NATO.
The President of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the name change referendum, has stated that he will ignore the vote.
However, the referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin &apos; s bells fall silent over the difficulties of Harlem churches
Historically, the older people I have spoken to say that there was a pub and a church on every corner, comments Mr. Adams.
There is no 'either/or' today.
He noted that the disappearance of bars was understandable.
People now socialise in a different way, he says.
Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighbourhoods to which people go regularly.
With regard to churches, it was concerned that the money raised from the sale of property would not last as long as the leaders expected and that &quot; sooner or later, they would come back to square one &quot;.
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings filled with the type of people who would not help the remaining sanctuaries in the neighbourhood.
The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white people, &quot; and therefore they will accelerate the closing of these churches, because it is unlikely that most of the people who move into these apartments will be members of these churches. &quot;
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin &apos; s a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation went in the 1930s of the 20th century.
A black congregation that worshipped there bought the building.
A black congregation took over St. Martin &apos; s, under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of merchants on 125th Street, a main shopping street in Harlem, who resisted hiring or promoting blacks.
In 1939, a fire severely damaged the building and, while the congregation of Father Johnson was planning for its reconstruction, they also ordered the bell.
The Reverend David Johnson, son and successor of Father Johnson in St. Martin, called them &quot; the poor man &apos; s campaigns &quot;.
In July, the expert who struck the gong called it &quot; a cultural treasure &quot; and &quot; an irreplaceable historical instrument &quot;.
In addition, the expert, Tiffany Ng, from the University of Michigan, noted that it was the first bass drum ever used by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who went on to play the larger Riverside Church bass drum 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather commented that Saint Martin did not replace him.
What has happened in St. Martin in recent months has been a complicated story of architects and contractors, some brought in by the lay leaders of the church and others by the diocese.
The parish board, the lay governing body of the parish, wrote to the diocese in July commenting on its concern that the diocese was &quot; trying to pass the costs &quot; on to the parish board, even though the board had not been involved in the hiring of the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old boy diving for lobsters in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while he was diving for abalone in California on the first day of the abalone season, according to authorities.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon &apos; s Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy calling for help, and he and a group of divers went to his aid.
Hammel commented that he initially thought he was just excited about catching a lobster, but then realized that he was &quot; screaming that he had been bitten &quot;.
Hammel noted when he arrived at the child &apos; s side.
Hammel added that he had shouted at everyone to get out of the water because there was a shark.
The child was transported by helicopter to Rady Children &apos; s Hospital, where he is in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
The rescuer, Captain Larry Giles, commented at a press conference that a shark had been sighted in the area some weeks earlier, but that it had not been considered a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim showed traumatic injuries in the upper chest area.
The authorities closed access to the beach, from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami Beach in Encinitas, for 48 hours for investigation and security reasons.
Giles noted that there were more than 135 shark species in the area, but that most were not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans drive the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's buys Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, which have many specialist staff on the shop floor of their style and beauty stores.
In order to significantly boost the UK beauty market, worth £2.8 billion and growing faster than the decline in fashion and homewares sales, the largest beauty halls will be trialled in 11 stores across the country and, if successful, rolled out to more stores next year.
Investment in beauty comes at the same time as this supermarket chain is looking for ways to use the space on shelves that used to be used for televisions, microwaves and household goods.
Sainsbury's stated that it would double its beauty offer with up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
In addition, more space will be given to existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees, with areas similar to those in other outlets, such as Boots.
The chain will also relaunch its Boutique makeup range with a majority of animal-friendly products, something increasingly demanded by younger customers.
The Fragrance Shop will also be testing its concessions in two Sainsbury &apos; s stores, the first of which was recently opened in Croydon, south London, last week, and the second of which will be opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shops and the shift towards daily small-quantity shopping in local shops force supermarkets to work hard to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, the executive director of Sainsbury's, has said that the stores will look increasingly like shopping centres as the supermarket chain tries to fight back against discount retailers Aldi and Lidl by offering more non-food products and services.
Sainsbury's has integrated Argos discount outlets into hundreds of stores and introduced several Habitat stores since its purchase of these chains two years ago. It is considered to have driven food sales and made these acquisitions profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket chain to renew its beauty and pharmacy departments was a failure.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots at the beginning of the 2000s, but the partnership ended after a discussion on how to split the income from the pharmaceutical product points in their supermarkets.
The new strategy is being pursued following the sale of 281 pharmaceutical outlets of Sainsbury to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million three years ago.
It is noted that Lloyds will be participating in the scheme, adding an expanded range of luxury skin care brands, such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
As Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director at Sainsbury's, commented: 'We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty aisles to enhance the environment for our customers.
In addition, we have invested in specialized staff who will be available to provide advice.
Our brand offer is designed to meet all needs, while an attractive environment and convenient location make us an irresistible destination for beauty products, challenging the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones is 'furious' after Holly Willoughby breaks a £11m deal
Dragon's Den star Peter Jones was 'furious' after TV presenter Holly Willoughby broke a £11 million deal with his lifestyle business to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time to devote to the Truly fashion and accessories brand.
This business had compared with Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop.
The presenter of This Morning, aged 37, announced that she was leaving the business on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has infuriated Dragon's Den star Peter Jones by quitting his lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute to focus on his extraordinary new deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was "furious" when the TV goldmine admitted that her new deals, worth up to £1.5 million, left no time for her fashion and accessories brand Truly, during a tense meeting at her business empire's headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, on Tuesday.
The business had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow &apos; s Goop brand and was expected to double Willoughby &apos; s fortune, which was estimated at about £11 million.
While Willoughby, aged 37, announced that he was leaving the business on Instagram, Jones was leaving Britain to go to one of his holiday homes.
As one source commented: &quot; Holly &apos; s main priority, by far.
It was to be their long-term future, which would keep them going for the next two decades.
His decision to leave left everyone involved completely stunned.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of goods at Marlow headquarters, ready to be sold.”
Experts believe that the departure of the presenter of This Morning, one of Britain's most profitable stars, could cost the company millions of pounds due to the significant investment in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothing, and could possibly delay its launch further.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, are the parents of three children and have been close friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for 10 years.
Willoughby set up Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, who is 52, joined as president in March.
The couples went on holiday together and Jones has a 40 per cent share in Baldwin &apos; s television production company.
Willoughby is to become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as presenter of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said that last night "no business was discussed."
A difficult conversation &quot; and then we fell in love &quot;
He joked about the criticism he receives from the media for making a comment that some would consider &quot; unpresidential &quot; and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump commented in his mocking voice of a news presenter.
I have not given up anything.
He noted that Kim was interested in meeting him again after Trump had praised the first meeting held in June in Singapore, which he had considered a great step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations for nuclear disarmament have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea &apos; s top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told the world &apos; s leaders gathered at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that his country does not see an &quot; adequate response &quot; from the United States to the first steps towards North Korea &apos; s disarmament.
On the contrary, the United States continued to apply sanctions in order to maintain pressure.
Trump's outlook was much more optimistic in his speech at his rally.
He said that he and North Korea were getting along just fine.
We were going to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
We have a fantastic relationship now.
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim had produced positive results: the end of missile tests, help in freeing hostages and bringing the remains of American soldiers home.
He also defended his unusual approach to the issue of relations with Kim by speaking of the relationship with him.
“It is very easy to be president, but then, instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into this stadium, we would have about 200 people right here,” Trump commented, pointing to the people right in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastate an island, leaving hundreds dead
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok had been displaced, a national emergency had not been declared, a prerequisite for international aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they do not want international assistance, which complicates things a little,” she explained.
While Save the Children was preparing a team to go to Palu, it was still unclear whether foreign staff could work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the national disaster agency, explained that the authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see whether international organizations would be allowed to provide assistance.
Given that land in Indonesia is constantly shifting, the country remains woefully unprepared when nature unleashes its fury.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not as common in other coastal areas.
The apparent lack of tsunami warning sirens in Palu, even with a prior warning, may have contributed to the loss of lives.
Even travelling from one island in Indonesia to another is a challenge.
Natural disasters further complicate logistics.
A hospital ship that was in Lombok to treat earthquake victims was heading to Palu, but would take at least three days to reach the enclave of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo made improving Indonesia &apos; s dilapidated infrastructure the central focus of his election campaign, and has allocated quite a bit of money to roads and railways.
However, the lack of funding has affected the administration of Mr. Joko, who is facing re-election next year.
It must also deal with the pressure of persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people died and tens of thousands were forced to flee their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with machetes, bows and arrows and other crude weapons.
Look at this: Daniel Sturridge, from Liverpool, equalises for Chelsea
Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge saved the Reds from defeat in the Premier League with a goal in the 89th minute against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri just over 27 metres from Chelsea &apos; s goal when the score was 1-0.
He placed the ball on his left foot with a touch before shooting at the second post.
The action was sent over the area and towards the upper right corner of the net.
Finally, the ball went over Kepa Arrizabalaga, who tried to stop it with a leap and fell into the net.
“I was trying to get into that position to get on the ball and the players like Shaq always play very forward, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante coming and I gave him a nudge. I did not think about it too much, I just fired.
Chelsea was leading 1-0 at half-time after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Blues' left-back made a darting run into the box and passed to Mateo Kovacic, who turned and dribbled into the Liverpool half.
Kovacic quickly passed the ball and ran into the middle.
He then made a lovely pass into the area, which brought Hazard into play.
Hazard was in front of the defence and finished with a left-footed shot into the far corner, which Alisson Becker, of Liverpool, could not stop.
On Wednesday, 15:00, Liverpool will play Napoli in the Champions League group stage at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Meanwhile, Chelsea face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
Number of tsunami victims in Indonesia rises to 832
The number of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has increased to 832, as reported by the Indonesian emergency agency early on Sunday.
Many people were trapped in the rubble of buildings that collapsed during the magnitude 7.5 earthquake that struck on Friday, which unleashed waves up to six metres high, according to the agency &apos; s spokesman, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, during a press briefing.
The city of Palu, with a population of over 380,000, was covered with debris from collapsed buildings.
A 32-year-old man was arrested by the police as a suspect in the murder of a woman who was stabbed to death
An investigation into murder has been launched after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with stab wounds in Grayson Mews, in John Street, leading to the arrest of a 32-year-old man as a suspect in the murder.
The police have urged people in the area who saw or heard anything to come forward to the police.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan commented: "The investigation is in its early stages, but I would encourage anyone who was in the vicinity of John Street, Birkenhead, and who saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us."
I would also recommend to anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have picked up anything on dashcam to contact us, as they may have vital information for our investigation.”
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman whose body was found is from Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
This afternoon, some people who claim to know the woman arrived at the crime scene to find out where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and the police have reported that they are in the process of informing the victim &apos; s family.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has tried to get back into his flat, but the police tell him that nobody can enter or leave the building.
He was shocked to discover what had happened.
Residents are now being informed that they will be allowed back in a few hours.
Someone heard an officer tell a man that the entire area was being treated as a crime scene.
A woman was crying at the scene.
It keeps repeating 'terrible'.
At 2 p.m., there were two police vans inside the cordon and one more outside.
Several officers were standing inside the cordon, monitoring the block of flats.
Anyone with information is asked to contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, registration number 247, on 30 September.
Cromwell statue at Parliament becomes latest'rewriting of history' success
Its prohibition would be a poetic act of justice for this Taliban-style destruction of so many cultural and religious objects in England by its puritanical fanatics.
However, the Cromwell Society described Mr Crick &apos; s suggestions as &quot; madness &quot; and an attempt to rewrite history.
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, commented: &quot; In the current debate on the removal of statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell would become a target.
The iconoclasm of the English civil wars was not ordered or carried out by Cromwell.
Cromwell the wronged may be sacrificed on the altar of his ancestor Thomas Cromwell's actions in the previous century.
The magnificent portrayal of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a testimony to the opinion of the nineteenth century and to part of the historiography of a figure that many consider worthy of celebration.
As Mr Goldsmith said in The Sunday Telegraph: 'Many people consider Cromwell, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than now, a defender of Parliament against external pressure, in this case the monarchy.
If it is a completely accurate description, then we can continue with the historical debate.
What is true is that the conflict of the mid-17th century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure that represents one side of that divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and commemoration.
A Chinese pig farmer is attacked by a killer pig
A pig attacked and killed a livestock farmer at a market in southwestern China, according to local media.
The man, identified only by his surname Yuan, was found dead with an artery cut and covered in blood near a pigsty in Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, as the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
On 30 May 2005, a pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines into pigs in a pigsty in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly travelled with his cousin from the neighbouring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The following morning, his uncle found him dead and discovered that the door of a nearby pigsty was open.
He said that there was a large pig with blood on its mouth in the pen.
The forensic examination confirmed that the pig weighing almost 250 kilograms had attacked the farmer to death, according to the report.
The legs of my cousin were bleeding and broken, he said, and he was identified by his surname, Wu, in the Guiyang Evening News.
The security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 p.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found approximately one hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told The Evening News that the pig was kept in a pen to prevent it from attacking anyone else, while police were collecting evidence at the scene.
It appears that Yuan &apos; s family and the market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, this is not the first time that a pig has attacked a person.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man seriously injured.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing almost 295 kilograms had cornered a farmer in his tractor until his wife scared it away.
After a herd of pigs in Oregon was eaten by a farmer in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a &quot; trigger &quot;.
They are just playing.
They are like children, very curious - their intention is not to do harm.
What is needed is the appropriate respect,” he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will bring widespread heavy rain to the south-west of the United States.
As expected, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the cooler waters of the north Mexican coast.
However, Rosa will bring heavy rains to the northern parts of Mexico and the south-west of the United States in the coming days.
Rose produced gusts of over 136 km/h, a hurricane of category 1, since Sunday 5 a.m. (Eastern time), and was located about 620 km south-southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move northward on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low pressure system is beginning to develop in the Pacific Ocean, moving eastward towards the West Coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday, a tropical storm will begin to push the heavy tropical rains northward, towards the south-eastern United States.
Rosa will leave more than 25 cm of rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Finally, as the tropical rain meets the approaching low pressure, widespread heavy rain will occur in the south-west over the next few days.
Locally, 2 to 10 cm of rain will cause dangerous flash floods, debris flows and possible desert slides.
Heavy tropical rains will cause precipitation rates of 5 to 8 inches per hour in specific areas, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 5 to 10 cm of rain is expected in parts of the south-west, especially in most of Arizona.
Because of the dispersed nature of tropical rainfall, sudden flash floods may occur with rapidly deteriorating conditions.
It is not recommended to go trekking in the desert during this period of heavy tropical rain.
Heavy rains could turn the canyons into raging rivers, and storms will cause strong winds and local dust clouds.
Weak pressure ridges approaching from the south will bring strong rains to specific areas of the southern California coast.
Heavy rains may leave up to two centimetres of water, which could cause small flows of debris and make roads slippery.
This would be the first heavy rain of the wet season in the region.
A few scattered tropical showers will approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before becoming widespread late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will extend to the Four Corners area on Tuesday and Wednesday.
In October, some intense temperature changes will be observed in the United States as the Arctic cools and the tropics warm.
This sometimes involves drastic changes in temperature over short distances.
A good example of these temperature differences will be what will happen across the whole of the United States on Sunday.
There will be a difference of almost 7 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the prolonged heat of summer will attempt to recover and expand again.
A warm start to October is expected in much of the central and eastern United States, with temperatures generally in the 20s from the southern Great Plains to parts of the north-east.
On Tuesday, temperatures in New York could reach 26 degrees, some 12 degrees above average.
Our long-term forecast indicates high probabilities of above-normal temperatures for the eastern United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh &apos; s testimony
More than 20 million people watched the harrowing testimonies of Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual assault in the 1980s, on six television networks on Thursday.
Meanwhile, the policy remained stalled and the media interrupted their regular programming to broadcast the latest developments from Friday: an agreement designed by Arizona Senator Jeff Blake to have the FBI conduct a week-long investigation of the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was absolutely certain that Kavanaugh groped her while she was drunk and that he tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
During his passionate testimony, Kavanaugh said he was 100 per cent sure that this did not happen.
More than 20.4 million people, as Nielsen noted on Friday, are likely to have seen it.
The company counted the average audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available to other channels that rebroadcast the event, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen often has some problems in calculating how many people see something in the office.
To put it in perspective, it is a hearing similar to that of an American football playoff or an Oscar ceremony.
Fox News Channel, whose commentators have strongly supported the nomination of Kavanaugh, is the leader, averaging 5.69 million viewers for a full-day hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was in second place with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had $3.1 billion, NBC had $2.94 billion, MSNBC had $2.89 billion and CNN had $2.52 billion, Nielsen commented.
Following the hearing, there was continued strong interest.
Flake was the central figure in the drama on Friday.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement saying it would vote for Kavanaugh, cameras at CNN and CBS captured protesters yelling at him as he tried to get into an elevator to attend a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Friday morning.
While receiving these criticisms, which were broadcast live by CNN, he appeared dejected.
One woman said to me, &quot; Looking me in the eye &quot;.
Do you think he is telling the truth to the country?
He went on: "You have power when there are so many women who do not have it."
Flake said that his office had issued a press release and, before the doors of the elevator closed, he would have more to say in his appearance before the Commission.
The cable and broadcast networks were all live hours later, when the Judicial Committee had to vote to put Kavanaugh's nomination to the Senate for a vote.
However, Flake said he would only do so if the FBI investigated the allegations against the candidate during the next week, which some Democrats had been calling for.
Flake was convinced, in part by the conversations he had had with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators later, Flake made his decision.
The Flake decision was critical, as it was clear that the Republicans would not have the votes to confirm Kavanaugh without that investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses Brexit critics of 'playing politics'
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of &quot; playing politics &quot; with the future of Britain and undermining national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
The British Prime Minister, Theresa May, is due to address the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview published alongside his on the front page of the newspaper, his former Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson, insisted on his attack on the so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that a proposal for Britain and the EU to pay each other's tariffs was "completely absurd."
Wayde murder: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson as suspect in LSU player &apos; s death
A suspect has been arrested by the police in the death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims during a shooting.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and charged with second-degree murder, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police report that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police recovered the glasses at the crime scene and said that they had found Simpson &apos; s DNA on them, according to WAFB, a CBS affiliate.
After questioning Simpson, the police say that he admitted shooting Wayde.
A bail of USD 350,000 has been set, according to the defence.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner &apos; s Office released a preliminary report on Friday indicating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the back of the head that had entered the head.
The department acknowledges the merits of the fugitive unit of the Louisiana State Police, the criminalistics laboratory of the State Police, the Southern University Police and the citizens for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva thanked the local police for their "diligence and pursuit of justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The player, who was over 2 metres tall, grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at LSU.
He had averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds in a game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said his team was &quot; devastated &quot; and &quot; in shock &quot; over Wayde &apos; s death.
These are the things that people always worry about, he commented.
Volcano spews ash over Mexico City
Ash from the Popocatepetl volcano had reached the districts south of the capital.
The National Centre for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after it showed activity and registered 183 gas and ash emissions in 24 hours.
The centre recorded several tremors and shakes.
On social media, the images showed thin layers of ash covering the windscreens of vehicles in districts of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed increased activity at the volcano, 72 kilometres south-east of the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck the centre of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as &quot; Don Goyo &quot;, has been active since 1994.
Police face Catalan separatists ahead of independence referendum anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence demonstrators clashed with riot police while thousands of people took part in anti-referendum demonstrations on the first anniversary of the polarized Catalan vote on secession.
A group of masked separatists who had been blocked by riot police hurled eggs and dust at them, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets, which are normally filled with tourists.
Fights also broke out later and the police used batons to control the situation.
For several hours, the independence groups, with slogans such as "Neither forgiveness nor forgetting," confronted unionist demonstrators, shouting "Long live Spain."
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests, according to local media.
Tensions remain high in this region one year after the 1 October vote, which Madrid considers illegal but which separatist Catalans celebrated.
The voters overwhelmingly chose independence, although turnout was low, as those opposed to secession boycotted the referendum in large numbers.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police attempted to stop voting at polling stations throughout the region, where there were violent clashes.
The pro-independence groups camped out on Friday night to avoid a demonstration in support of the National Police.
The demonstration continued, but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician attending the separatist protest with his wife, said that he no longer had any hope that Catalonia would become independent.
Last year was one of our best years.
I saw my parents crying with joy at being able to vote, but now we are stuck,” he commented.
Despite a narrow but vital victory in the regional elections last December, the pro-coup parties have struggled to retain the momentum this year, as many of their most prominent leaders, either in self-imposed exile or in detention, await trial for their role in organizing the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed the protest in support of the police on his phone, said that the conflict had been fanned by politicians on both sides.
“The situation is becoming increasingly tense,” he said.
On Saturday, one of the nine Catalan leaders in preventive detention since the end of last year, Oriol Junqueras, announced that he would be participating in the European Parliament elections next year.
"To stand for the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression in democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish Government," he said.
Londonderry: men arrested for ramming a house with a car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after repeatedly driving into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at about 7.30 p.m. on Thursday in Ballynagard Crescent.
Inspector Bob Blemmings commented that the entrances and the building itself had been damaged.
At some point, the car may have been shot at with a crossbow.
A Menga attack gave Livingston a 1-0 victory over Rangers
The first goal by Dolly Menga for Livingston ensured the victory
A Livingston promoted impressed Rangers with a second defeat for Steven Gerrard in 18 games as manager of the club at Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's goal made the difference. Gary Holt's goal took Hibs to second place.
This season, Gerrard's team have yet to win away from home and next Sunday they face Hearts, who lead the table by eight points.
Previously, Rangers would play Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the Europa League.
Meanwhile, Livingston extended their run of wins in the division to six games, while manager Kenny Miller has yet to taste defeat since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses chances against a resolute visitor
The Holt team should have gone a step further before marking, causing all sorts of problems for the Rangers with their direct play.
Scott Robinson beat the defence but his shot was saved by Alan Lithgow, who then had a shot deflected into the net after a header from Craig Halkett.
The host team was content to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause problems for the visitors with their ball-in-the-net play.
That was how the decisive goal came about.
Rangers gave them a free shot and Livingston sought an opening, with a combined play from Declan Gallagher and Robinson for Menga, who struck the ball and scored from the centre of the area.
At that point Rangers had possession, but were unable to break down the home defence and Liam Kelly, the home goalkeeper, was relatively untroubled.
That continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced a Kelly stop.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor blocked a shot from Scott Pittman with his foot and Livingston were denied a goal by a long range effort from Lithgow.
There were long passes into Livingston constantly, but they were always cleared. Two penalty appeals were turned down, one after Halkett &apos; s run on substitute Glenn Middleton and one for a hand.
Livingston &apos; s &quot; Phenomenal &quot; (analysis)
Alasdair Lamont, BBC Scotland, at Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
The unanimous view is that they played an excellent game that continued to exceed expectations of an upward trajectory.
Their style of play and their squad have hardly changed since his elevation, but this is largely due to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since his arrival.
It had many heroes.
Halkett, the captain, was immense and led a magnificently organised defence, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes at all times.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although they had some very good moments with Gerrard, they were short of goals.
They failed to materialize the plays, as they only managed to penetrate the opposition's half of the pitch once, which is a warning to Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan received an ambiguous welcome in Cologne
On Saturday 29 September, there were smiles and blue skies at breakfast for the leaders of Turkey and Germany in Berlin.
It is the last day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan to Germany, with the aim of restoring relations between NATO allies.
They have discussed issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to inaugurate a huge new mosque.
The city hosts the largest population of Turks outside Turkey.
The police cited security concerns to prevent 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters gathered in the vicinity to see their president.
Hundreds of opponents of Erdogan, many of them Kurds, also spoke out against both his policies and the German government &apos; s decision to receive him in the country.
These demonstrations reflect the divisive nature of this visitor, who is received as a hero by some German Turks and as an autocrat by others.
Traffic accident in Deptford: cyclist dies after colliding with a vehicle
A cyclist has died in a car accident in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwookd Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, south-east of the city, at 1015.
The driver of the car stopped and the cyclist was attended to by paramedics, but he died on the spot.
The accident occurred after another cyclist was killed after being hit by a vehicle that drove off in Childers Street, almost two kilometres from the site of Saturday &apos; s accident.
The Metropolitan Police said that officers were working to identify the man and inform his family.
Roads have been blocked and buses diverted, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: six officers injured during disturbances
Six prison officials were injured in a brawl in a high-security prison for men, according to the prison directorate.
The disturbances began at Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire at about 9.30 a.m. on Sunday and are still continuing.
Specialists from an elite team (known as &quot; Tornado &quot;) are in charge of controlling the disturbances, involving eight inmates and affecting one wing.
The officers were given first aid for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A spokesman for the prison service commented: &quot; Specialist prison staff have been deployed to deal with the current incident at Long Lartin prison.
Six staff members have received medical assistance for injuries.
In our prisons, violence is not tolerated and we make it clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and could spend more time in prison.”
Long Lartin prison holds over 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous offenders in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had received hospital medical assistance after being attacked by a prisoner.
In addition, in October last year, riot police were called to the prison to deal with a serious disturbance in which prison staff were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (arid areas could benefit)
It is unusual for a tropical depression to reach Arizona, but that is exactly what could happen early next week when the remnants of Hurricane Rosa pass through the south-west desert, with the risk of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday in the western Arizona, southern Nevada and eastern California and southern Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to head directly to Phoenix on Tuesday, leaving rain behind by the end of Monday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix commented in a tweet that &quot; only 10 hurricanes have maintained their tropical storm or depression status within a 321-kilometre radius of Phoenix since 1950.
In 1967, Hurricane Katrina came within 65 kilometres of the Arizona border.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 inches of rainfall, with up to 15 inches in isolated areas of the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Rainfall of 2 to 5 cm is likely, with the possibility of 10 cm in isolated locations, in other parts of the southwest desert, including the Rockies and the Great Basin.
In places where there is no risk of flash floods, the Rosa rains can be considered a blessing, as the region is suffering from drought.
Although a flood is a very serious matter, some of these torrential rains are likely to be beneficial because of the current drought conditions in the south-west.
According to the United States Drought Monitor, more than 40 per cent of Arizona is suffering from at least extreme drought, the second highest category, as reported on weather.com.
First, the route of Hurricane Rosa will hit the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rose, which is expected to remain a hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 136 kilometres per hour on Sunday morning, is located 619 kilometres south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is moving northward at 19 kilometres per hour.
The storm is encountering cooler waters in the Pacific, and is therefore losing strength.
Thus, it is expected to hit Mexico with the intensity of a tropical storm during the afternoon of Monday.
Heavy rainfall is expected in parts of Mexico, which are at considerable risk of flooding.
“Heavy rains of 7 to 15 cm are expected from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with the possibility of reaching 25 cm, as reported by weather.com.
Rosa will then move northward as a tropical storm, before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression. It will then move across Arizona into southern Utah late Tuesday night.
The main danger to Rosa or its remains is the heavy rain in Baja California, north-west Sonora and south-west United States.
These rains are expected to cause dangerous flash floods and debris flows in the deserts, as well as landslides in mountain areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with knife wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the area of Excelsior Terrace, Midsomer Norton, at about 4:00 a.m. on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital, where he is &quot; stable &quot;.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and one 20-year-old were arrested that same night in the Radstock area of Somerset, according to the Avon and Somerset Constabulary.
The officers have appealed to anyone who may have recorded the incident on their mobile phone.
Trump says Kavanaugh &quot; suffered the meanness and anger of the Democratic Party &quot;
Trump said voting for Judge Kavanaugh was a vote to reject the "dishonest and disgusting tactics" of the Democratic Party.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has &quot; suffered the meanness and the anger &quot; of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, denying Christine Blasey Ford &apos; s accusation that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers, in an emotional and emphatic manner.
Ford also testified at the hearing on this allegation.
On Saturday, the President said that, on that day, 'Americans saw the cunning, the quality and the courage' of Kavanaugh.
“Voting to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is voting to confirm one of the most accomplished legalists of our day, a jurist with an admirable record of public service,” he told his supporters in West Virginia.
The President made indirect references to Judge Kavanaugh &apos; s nomination in speaking about the importance of Republican participation in midterm elections.
There are five weeks to go to one of the most important elections in our lives.
I am not running, but it is a race,” he noted.
That is why I go from one place to another, fighting to get great candidates.
Trump claimed that the Democrats are on a mission of'resistance and obstruction.'
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on the nomination of Kavanaugh is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior Republican official told CNN.
Hundreds dead in earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, number rising
At least 384 people have died and many have been swept away by the huge waves that have been battering the beaches after a strong earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, as reported by the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered on the beach in Palu city to celebrate a festival on Friday night when waves as high as six metres came ashore in the evening, sweeping many to their deaths and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami occurred after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
When it was reported yesterday that a tsunami might occur, people were still on the beach and did not immediately flee, so they were victims, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Indonesian National Agency for Disaster Management (BNPB), at a press conference in Jakarta.
The tsunami did not come alone, it brought cars, logs, houses, everything on land, he commented. The tsunami had moved across the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
He also added that some people had climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
The photographs published by the agency showed the destruction of many buildings and shops, collapsed bridges and mosques, and a mosque surrounded by water.
Repeated strikes continued to hit the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquake was felt in an area with 2.4 million people.
The Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT, in Indonesian) reported in a press release that the energy released by the great earthquake on Friday was 200 times greater than that of the atomic bomb that fell on Hiroshima during World War II.
He added that the geography of the city, which is situated at the end of a long and narrow bay, could have magnified the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as &quot; significant &quot; and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He said that bodies of some victims had been found trapped under the rubble of the buildings that had been destroyed, and 540 people had been injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho noted that the number of victims and damage could be higher along the 300 km of coastline north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicentre of the earthquake.
Communications were &quot; totally paralyzed and there was no information &quot; from Donggala, he commented.
The Red Cross said in a statement that more than 300,000 people were living there, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
This is already a tragedy in itself, but it could be much worse, he said.
On Saturday, the agency was heavily criticized for failing to report that a tsunami had hit Palu, although the agency's officials claim that the waves had already reached the coast by the time the alert was issued.
In a recording made by an amateur and shared on social media, a man on the top floor of a building is heard warning people on the street that a tsunami was approaching.
In minutes, a wall of water hits the coast, sweeping away buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to validate the material immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major blackout in the vicinity of Palu, hampering the coordination of rescue efforts by the authorities.
The army began to send cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, the authorities say, but the evacuees still need food and other basic commodities.
The city airport has been reopened for relief work only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has a planned visit to the evacuation centres in Paul on Sunday.
The number of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia is over 800.
That is very bad.
While World Vision staff in Donggala had arrived safely in Palu city, where they were sheltering under tarpaulins in the garden of their offices, they had seen a devastating scene on their way, Mr. Doseba said.
He said that he was told that many houses had been destroyed.
That is very bad.
Even as aid groups were gearing up their disaster assistance machinery, some people were complaining that experienced aid workers were not being allowed to go to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, foreign funding, supplies and personnel can only be used if the affected site is declared a national disaster area.
That has not yet happened.
“It is still a disaster at the provincial level,” commented Aulia Arriani, the Indonesian Red Cross spokesperson.
As long as the Government says that it is a national disaster, we can start to provide international aid, but that has not happened yet.
As the second night fell in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami of Friday, friends and relatives of the people still missing still had the hope that their loved ones would be the miracles that would bring some light to the desolate stories that natural disasters write.
A small child was pulled from a sewer on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days next to the body of her mother.
Gendon Subandono, instructor of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which had concluded earlier that month in Indonesia.
Other students of his, including Mr. Mandagi, were trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel.
“By my experience in the paragliding field, I carry my own emotional baggage,” he commented.
Mr. Gendon recalled how, in the hours following the news that the Roa Roa hotel had collapsed in the paragliding community, he had sent desperate WhatsApp messages to competitors in Palu, who were participating in the beach festival.
However, their messages only showed a grey verification mark, not two blue ones.
He said he believed that meant the messages had not been delivered.
Thieves steal $26,750 during an ATM cash load in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, a Brink employee was robbed of $26,750 while refilling an ATM at Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the vehicle had emptied an ATM machine located in the entertainment centre and was preparing to reload it with more money, Detective McCarthy wrote in the note.
While he was busy, another man "came running from behind the Brink employee and stole a bag of money that was to be reloaded."
According to the note, witnesses saw several suspects leaving the scene, but the police did not specify the number of persons involved in the incident.
Anyone with information on their identities should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West will start to be known as Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday: &quot; The person formerly known as Kanye West &quot;.
West, who is 41, has been known as Ye for some time now, and he used the name as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to unveil his new album, Yandhi.
She replaces Ariana Grande, who had to cancel her performance for &quot; emotional reasons &quot;, as the show &apos; s creator commented.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West had previously stated that the word had a religious significance for him.
“I think it is the most used word in the Bible, where it means ‘you,’” West commented earlier this year while discussing the album title with radio host Big Boy.
"I am you, we are us" means we.
It went from Kanye, which means 'the one,' to Ye, a reflection of our good, bad and confused things, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are.”
He is one of the many famous rapists who has changed his name.
Sean Combs has been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
A former collaborator of West, JAY-Z, has used his name in capital letters or lower case, with or without a script.
Mexican AMLO promises not to use the army against the civilian population
Andrés Manuel López Obrador, the Mexican President-elect, has promised never to use the army against the civilian population, now that the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students in the country is approaching.
On Saturday, López Obrador pledged in Tlatelolco Square that "he would never use the army to repress the people of Mexico."
On 2 October 1968, the troops fired on a peaceful demonstration in the plaza, killing 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were gaining strength throughout Latin America.
López Obrador has committed to supporting Mexican youth by providing monthly stipends to those who study and by opening more free public universities.
He stated that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities led young people to join criminal gangs.
USA should double its funding for I.A.
Now that China is more active in AI, the US should double its investment in AI research, says Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and AI professional who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow announcements by various parts of the US Government, including when the US as a whole lacks an official IAEA strategy.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: its goal is to become the number 1 in innovation in I A by 2030.
“Doubling the budget for I. A. research would be a good start, given that all other countries are lagging far behind the United States. We are looking to the next step in the field of I. A.” Lee comments.
Double the funding means double the chances of the next big breakthrough in I. A. being achieved in the United States, as Lee stated in an interview with CNBC this week.
Mr. Lee, whose book &quot; AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order &quot; was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the executive director of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China &apos; s most important AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat the best American player of Othello. Subsequently, he was an executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google China.
He acknowledged the previous technological competitions of the United States Government, such as the DARPA Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be, which would identify the next generation of visionaries.
In the United States, researchers often had to work hard to obtain government grants, he said.
“It is not China that is taking the academic leaders; it is the corporations,” Lee noted.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired prominent academics to work on AI.
He commented that changes in migration policy could also help the United States to intensify its efforts in Iraq.
“I think that doctors in I. A. should have permanent residence cards automatically,” he said.
The Chinese State Council presented its Plan for the Development of the Next Generation of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
The National Natural Science Foundation of China funds individuals from academic institutions as well as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations in the United States fund American researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee commented.
In the beginning of this year, the US Department of Defence established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Centre, whose purpose is to attract partners from industry and academia. The White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, this month DARPA announced an investment of USD 2 billion in a project called AI Next.
As for the National Science Foundation, it currently invests more than $100 million per year in research on I.A.
Meanwhile, the United States legislation to create a National Commission for Artificial Intelligence Security has not taken any action for months.
The Macedonians decided in a referendum whether to change the name of their country
The people of Macedonia decided in a referendum held on Sunday whether their name will be changed to "Republic of North Macedonia," a gesture that would resolve a decades-long conflict with Greece, which had blocked its candidacy for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim to its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, both Governments reached an agreement on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would diminish the ethnic identity of the Slav majority population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has cast doubt on whether participation will reach the minimum required 50 % to make the referendum valid.
The question in the referendum paper was: 'Are you in favour of joining NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?'
The proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying for Macedonia, one of the countries emerging from the disintegration of Yugoslavia, to try to join bodies such as the EU and NATO.
I have come to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because this means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it will not be legally binding, quite a number of Members have said that they will respect the result of the vote so that it will be decisive.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission declared that, at 1 p.m., no irregularities had been reported.
However, participation was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters cast their ballots.
I have come to vote for my children, our place is in Europe, said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who was voting in the capital, Skopie.
Zoran Zaev, the Prime Minister of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko cast their votes in the referendum on the name change of the country that would open the way for joining NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing a small stage and removing chairs from the tents set up by those who were boycotting the referendum.
We are in favour of joining NATO and the EU, but we want to do it with our heads held high, not through the back door, said Kavadarkov.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want us to enter as Macedonia, we can establish relations with other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of the Euro-Asian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership would bring the investment that Macedonia so badly needs, with an unemployment rate of over 20%.
I believe that the great majority will be in favour, as more than 80% of the citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO, said Zaev after casting his vote.
He said that a positive outcome would be a &quot; confirmation of our future &quot;.
A poll published last Monday by the Institute for Policy Studies claimed that between 30 and 43 per cent of voters would participate in the referendum, which is lower than the required turnout.
Another poll conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia revealed that 57 per cent of those polled intended to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote in favour.
For the referendum to be considered a success, participation must be 50 % plus one vote.
If it fails, it would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western policy of the Government since it came to power last May.
Look at this: Sergio Agüero, of Manchester City, evades the whole of the Brighton defence to score a goal
Sergio Agüero and Raheem Sterling tore through the Brighton defence in Manchester City &apos; s 2-0 win at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, on Saturday.
For Agüero, it was ridiculously easy to score a goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine right-back was given a yellow card in the first few minutes of the match.
He ran between three Brighton defenders before entering open play.
Once there, he was surrounded by four green T-shirts.
He evaded one defender before outpacing several more on the Brighton end.
He made a left turn, where Sterling was.
The English striker used his first touch in the area to return the ball to Agüero, who struck it with his right foot to avoid Mathew Ryan with a shot that went just wide of the right post.
“Agüero has a few problems with his foot,” Pep Guardiola, the City manager, told the journalists.
We were talking about 55 to 60 minutes.
That is what happened.
We were lucky that he scored at that moment.
However, it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League contest.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
In this play, Agüero received the ball very close to the Brighton goal.
He made a lovely ball to the left wing for Leroy Sane.
Sane gave Sterling a few touches before sending him to the second post.
The Sky Blues striker headed the ball into the net just before he left the field.
The City faces Hoffenheim in a Champions League group match on Tuesday, 12:55 p.m. at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to spoil the Rockies' party
With the Nationals eliminated from the playoff, there was no reason to force another opening.
Even so, the always competitive Scherzer is hoping to step on the mound on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if they, the Los Angeles Dodgers, have won the National League West Division, and still have a chance in the playoffs.
The Rockies at least secured one wildcard spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they are still chasing their first division title.
Although we are not playing for anything, at least we can go out there with the certainty that the Denver crowd will be excited and that the other team will probably play at the highest level I have faced this year.
Why would you not want to participate?”
The Nationals still have to announce an opener for Sunday, but it seems they are leaning towards leaving Scherzer in that situation.
Scherzer, who would be making his opening statement No. 34, held a practice session on Thursday and will return to his normal rest on Sunday.
The record of the masterful Washington is 18 wins and 7 losses, with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 innings.
Trump holds rally in West Virginia
The President made indirect references to the Brett Kavanaugh situation, his nomination to the Supreme Court, when speaking about the importance of Republican participation in midterm elections.
In November everything we have done is at stake.
There are five weeks to go to one of the most important elections in our lives.
It is one of the most important. I am not running, but I am campaigning, going from place to place to get great candidates,” he said.
And he continued: 'We have this terrible radical group of democrats, they are passing now.
And they are determined to regain power by any means necessary, and we see the meanness, the malice.
They do not care who they hurt or who they have to step on to get power and control, that is what they want, power and control, and we are not going to give it to them.
Democrats, he said, were engaged in a mission of "resistance and obstruction."
“We saw it these last four days,” he said, saying that the Democrats were “angry, bad, horrible and false.”
He referred to the Judicial Committee of the Senate by naming Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who was booed by the audience.
Do you remember his answer?
Do you filter the document?
Mmm, mmm, what?
No, no, I am waiting for an answer. Your body language was terrible, the worst I have ever seen.”
The Labour Party already encompasses a wide range of views.
It is intolerant of people who speak their minds
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censure me, I was hardly surprised.
After all, I am the last in a line of Labour Members of Parliament to be told that we are not welcome, just for speaking our minds.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated in a similar way, categorically stating that she was against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticised me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
He disagreed with the importance of a responsible economic policy, in terms of national security, for Europe. It was ironic that it was on issues on which Jeremy was at odds with previous leaders.
As stated in the notice for the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting on Friday, 'we want our meetings to be inclusive and productive'.
For most of the eight years that I have been a Member of the local Labour Party Parliament, that is exactly what the Friday night meetings of the General Committee have been.
Unfortunately, this is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of a &quot; kinder and gentler &quot; policy is already forgotten, if it ever was implemented at all.
It is becoming increasingly clear that differing opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that every opinion is judged on whether or not the party leaders consider it acceptable.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues with whom he had previously thought shared a similar political vision started expecting him to radically change his opinions and take positions with which he would never have agreed, whether on national security or on the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public, regardless of what I say, there is a diatribe of insults on social media demanding my removal, denouncing the policies of the centre, telling me that I should not be in the Labour Party.
I am not the only one to have experienced this.
I know that I am luckier than some of my colleagues, because the comments about me tend to be political.
I am amazed at the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face a torrent of sexist or racist abuse every day, but never run away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the normalization of insults.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer have that broad range of views and, with every 'censorship' motion or every change in the selection rules, the party becomes narrower.
In the last two years, I have received many pieces of advice telling me to keep my head down and not make too much noise and that I would then be 'well-behaved'.
But I have not entered politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, as a schoolboy, motivated by the neglect of the Thatcher Government which left my comprehensive school literally in ruins, I have tried to support improvements in public services for those who need them most, either as a councillor or as a Minister in Government.
I have never hidden my political views, and I did not do so in the last election.
It is impossible for anyone in Nottingham East to have been unaware of my political positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
I would say to those who promoted the motion on Friday that I do not understand this desire to waste time and energy on questions about my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party when the country is heading for a Brexit that will affect households, businesses and public services.
The real message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to the voters, be they Labour or not: I am proud to serve them and I promise that no threat of withdrawal and no political opportunism will stop me from acting in what I believe to be best for all of you.
Chris Leslie is the Member of Parliament for Nottingham East
Ayr 38 - Melrose 17: an undefeated Ayr tops the table
Two late goals may have decided the final outcome, but Ayr certainly deserved the victory in this entertaining Premiership match.
They are now at the top of the table and the only undefeated team of the ten participating teams.
In the end, it was the superiority of their defence, as well as their ability to make the most of opportunities, that gave the local team the victory, and Coach Peter Murchie had every right to be pleased.
“We have been tested in all parties and we have come out victorious, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose commented: 'Ayr deserves the recognition, they took the opportunities better than us.'
Grant Anderson's try at 14, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead, but a yellow card to Scotland captain Rory Hughes, on loan from Warriors for the match, gave Melrose the advantage and Jason Baggot's try was not converted.
Ayr extended their lead with a penalty, just before half-time, and then converted a penalty to make the score 17-5 to Ayr at the break.
However, Melrose started well in the second half and Patrick Anderson's try, converted by Baggot, reduced this deficit to five points.
There was a long stoppage for a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who had to be stretchered off, and Ayr went ahead with a Stafford McDowall try converted by Climo.
The yellow card to Blair Macpherson, captain of Ayr, allowed Melrose to take advantage of having one more man with a non-converted Bruce Colvine, at the end of a period of great pressure.
However, the posts were recovered and when yellow carded for not having the ball, MacPherson made a try from the back of the maul, which was moving forward, when Struan Hutchinson was shown the red card for punching Climo.
The wind had blown the ball from Kyle Rowe after he had kicked it from David Armstrong &apos; s boot and sent Gregor Henry over the line for the fifth time to win the match.
Still Game star wants to go into catering
Still Game star Ford Kieran appears to be determined to move into the catering business after it emerged that he had been appointed manager of a chain of restaurants.
The actor of 56 years is Jack Jarvis on the famous BBC programme, which he writes and co-produces with his comedy partner of many years, Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the ninth season will be the last in the series, and it seems that Kiernan is making plans for life after Craiglang.
According to the official register, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the matter, although a Scottish Sun source noted that Kiernan wanted to get involved in the “booming Glasgow restaurant scene.”
The sea is ours: a landlocked Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the route to the Pacific
The sailors are guarding a naval headquarters in La Paz.
Blue flags are flying on public buildings.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, naval bases bear the motto: &quot; The sea is ours by right &quot;.
It is a duty to recover it.
In all of Bolivia, a land without sea, they still vividly remember the lost coast to Chile in a bloody conflict over resources that took place in the nineteenth century, and the longing to return to the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may be the greatest in decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling from the International Court of Justice on 1 October, after five years of deliberations.
Bolivia has the impetus, a spirit of unity and calm, and is, of course, awaiting the outcome with a positive vision, commented a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the International Court of Justice ruling on large screens spread throughout the country, hoping that the Hague court will rule in favour of Bolivia &apos; s claim that, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile has an obligation to negotiate to grant Bolivia sovereign access to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous President of Bolivia, who is engaged in a controversial battle for re-election next year, also has much to say about the resolution of Monday.
He promised in late August that we are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will rule in Bolivia &apos; s favour and that the situation would change little if it did.
The Netherlands-based UN agency had no power to award Chilean territory and had stipulated that it would not determine the outcome of any possible talks.
The fact that the International Court of Justice &apos; s ruling came only six months after the final arguments indicated that the case &quot; was not complicated &quot;, said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
Far from promoting the cause of Bolivia, the last four years may have hampered it.
The problem of access to the sea had been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration, he said.
He also suggested that the bellicose rhetoric of Morales had undermined any residual Chilean goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to have a conversation after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
The former President of Bolivia, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, who was the representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court &apos; s decision-making was unusually swift.
On Monday, he said, Bolivia would be offered &quot; an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile &quot; and the possibility of &quot; ending 139 years of mutual benefits &quot;.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who remains one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, was using the maritime issue as a political football.
Bolivia would never renounce its right to access the Pacific Ocean, he added.
The resolution is an opportunity to see that we have to leave the past behind.
North Korea says that there will be no nuclear disarmament unless it can trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said that his nation would never be the first to give up nuclear disarmament if it could not trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
It urged the United States to honour the pledges made at a summit in Singapore between the rival leaders.
His comments come at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of restarting diplomatic talks on nuclear issues that have been stalled for more than three months since this summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.
Ri said that the continuation of the continued sanctions and the United States &apos; opposition to a declaration that would end the Korean War and subject the North to the South was a &quot; chimera &quot;.
Washington is reluctant to accept the declaration without some meaningful disarmament movement by Pyongyang.
Both Kim and the US President, Donald Trump, want to hold another summit.
However, there is widespread scepticism about the seriousness of Pyongyang &apos; s willingness to give up an arsenal that the country probably considers as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for another summit of the leaders.
The latest in giant hats are about to land on a street near you, as Paris fashion parades reveal
If you want to increase your collection of hats or protect yourself from the sun, you have come to the right place.
Valentino and Thom Browne designers presented a collection of eccentric large hats for their spring/summer 2019 collection on the runway, dazzling the style of Paris Fashion Week.
Impossible hats have flooded Instagram this summer and these designers have brought their spectacular creations to the runway.
The most outstanding piece of Valentino was a beige hat with a wide brim adorned with feathers that covered the heads of the models.
Other large-scale additions included a watermelon with jewels, a witch's hat and even a pineapple, but they are not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of extravagant masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colourful masks had sewn-on lips and bore more resemblance to Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation resembled a complete diving team, including mask, snorkel and fins, while another looked like a melted ice-cream cone.
If you like big fashion, you are in luck.
Hunters for style predict that the enormous hats could start to appear on the streets of shops.
The big hats are coming back in a big way, courtesy of 'La Bomba', with a wide-brimmed straw hat with a 60-centimetre brim being worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind this impractical hat that flooded social media presented another great creation on the catwalk: a beach bag as big as the model in the bikini that was carrying it.
The raffia-woven orange-brown bag, decorated with raffia fringe and with a white leather handle, was the main piece of the La Riviera collection by Jacquemus for the spring-summer 2019 season at Paris Fashion Week.
As stylist to the stars Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'Next summer I hope to see huge beach bags and hats on the streets. Since the designer has had such an impact, it would be hard to ignore the demand for large accessories'.
John Edward: linguistic skills are essential for citizens of the world
Scotland &apos; s independent schools have a track record of academic excellence that has continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding results in examinations, which is further enhanced by individual and collective success in sport, the arts, music and other community projects.
With over 30,000 pupils in every corner of Scotland, these centres, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), are striving to deliver the best possible service to pupils and parents.
Independent schools are designed to prepare their students for further education, for the career they choose and for the place they will occupy as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement an adapted curriculum, modern languages are still popular and desired subjects in schools.
As Nelson Mandela said, &quot; If you talk to a man in a language he understands, he will listen to you.
If you speak to them in their language, it reaches their heart.
This is a powerful reminder that, if one wants to establish relations and build trust with people from other countries, one cannot rely solely on English.
If we look at the results of the examinations this year, we can see that languages are at the top of the ranking tables, with the highest pass rates in independent schools.
In total, 68 per cent of pupils who studied foreign languages obtained an A, the highest grade.
Data from the 74 centres in the SCIS showed that 72 per cent of students achieved an A in Chinese, 72 per cent in German, 69 per cent in French and 63 per cent in Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a fundamental skill that will be needed by children and young people in the future without doubt.
Languages are now considered to be on a par with the STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculum of independent schools and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 found that 17 per cent of employers cited language skills as a barrier to filling jobs.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly indispensable for preparing young people for their future careers.
The potential for employment requiring language skills is increasing, and these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career path someone chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future, thanks to this kind of lifelong competence.
The fact that he can communicate directly with people from foreign countries will enable him to get ahead of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of over 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75 per cent of them did not speak any foreign language well enough to hold a conversation, and the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15 per cent, was French.
For this reason, investing in language education is important for today's children.
If they know several languages, especially those of developing economies, they will be better equipped to have better opportunities to find quality employment.
In Scotland, different languages will be taught in different schools.
Some centres will focus on the more classical modern languages, while others will teach the languages considered most important for the United Kingdom by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the child &apos; s interests, independent schools always offered a choice of several languages taught by specialist staff.
Scotland &apos; s independent schools are dedicated to providing an environment of learning that prepares children and equips them with the skills to succeed, whatever the future holds.
At present, it is undeniable that, in a global business environment, languages continue to be vital to the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages must be considered &quot; competencies for international communication &quot;.
Independent schools will continue to offer these options, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
It must be done.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Independent Schools Council
LeBron James makes his debut with the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
The wait for fans waiting to see LeBron James make his debut with the Los Angeles Lakers is about to end.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play the preseason opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
However, it is still not clear how many minutes he will play.
“It will be more than one and less than 48,” Walton commented on the Lakers official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James was likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After a training session earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers &apos; preseason schedule.
At this stage of my career, I do not need pre-season parties to prepare myself, he said.
Trump rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is holding a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five Trump rallies scheduled for next week, including stops in Trump-friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote for his nominee to fill the Supreme Court vacancy on hold, Trump is seeking support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when the votes are cast in November.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight and how can it be watched online?
Donald Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m. this evening, Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can watch it online via a live YouTube broadcast.
Trump is likely to comment on this week &apos; s Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh &apos; s testimony, which was marred by allegations of sexual misconduct and has left a Senate confirmation vote on his nomination on hold for at least a week, pending an FBI investigation.
However, the main objective of this series of rallies is to help the Republicans facing the November elections to get a boost.
Thus, the President &apos; s campaign noted that the five rallies next week are intended to &quot; energize volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand their majorities in the Senate and the House &quot;, according to Reuters.
“Congressional oversight is so crucial to his agenda that the President will travel to as many states as possible as we head into the campaign,” said a Trump campaign spokesman, who declined to be named.
The rally scheduled for tonight at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could draw supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media coverage from Pittsburgh, as reported by West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in a month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state he won by over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, the Republican candidate for the Senate in West Virginia, who is trailing in the polls.
For Morrisey, it is not a good sign that the president has to come and push him in the polls," commented Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: the US team shows that it is brave enough to fight to keep the hope alive for the individual matches on Sunday.
After three individual sessions, foursomes on Saturday afternoon may be just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum of momentum is a completely invented sporting concept, but the players do believe in it, even more so in competitions like this.
So where is the impetus now?
“We were six points ahead and now we are four points behind, so I guess that is a little bit of a momentum shift,” Jordan Spieth commented after the day &apos; s play.
Europe has an advantage, of course: four points ahead with twelve more at stake.
As Spieth points out, the Americans feel they have a bit of wind behind them and plenty of reasons to be cheerful, not least the partnership of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and managed three points apiece.
Spieth has been deadly off the tee and preaches by example.
The guttural roars of celebration grew louder as they made their way around, introducing a vital putt for a half on the fourth hole when they and Thomas were two down after two.
The putt they gave them on the 15th was greeted with a similar cry, one that said, 'I think the American team is still in it.'
“What needs to be done is to redouble efforts and focus on the party,” he commented.
That is what these players have done.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas over the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undeniable history of the Ryder Cup.
The odd and adorable couple of Europe are four from four and nothing can go wrong.
Moliwood was the only pair to avoid a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday evening and in the last nine holes of Friday morning.
That run and the way it is flowing with the boisterous crowd leaves no doubt that these are the players to beat on Sunday, and that there will be no more popular players than Fleetwood and Molinari to seal a possible European victory when the sun sets at Le Golf National.
Preferably, in different holes.
However, it is still too early to talk about European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson dispatched Sergio Garcia, the hero of the four-ball morning, after teaming with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first nine holes buried the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole from which they could not escape.
But there will be no help to get out of the holes on Sunday.
Fourballs and foursomes are fascinating to watch up close because you see the interaction between the partners, the advice they give and the advice they do not give, and the way a strategy can change in an instant.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and has a big lead going into the last day, but this foursomes session also showed that the US team is not afraid to fight, something that some, especially the Americans, doubted.
Europe leads by 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe has a good lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup, after finishing foursomes and fourballs with a 10-6 win over the United States.
The pair of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the way with two wins over a struggling Tiger Woods, who fell four places in the Le Golf National rankings.
European Thomas Bjorn, trying to retain the trophy he lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated a United States team that made many errors in the morning foursomes, which ended 3-1.
The United States team won two foursomes matches, but did not close the gap.
American Jim Furyk needs to gain eight points from the 12 individual matches on Sunday to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first rookie European to win four points in a row, and he and Molinari, who were dubbed “Molliwood” after a sensational weekend, are the second pair to win four points in their first four matches in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the foursomes, their magnificent partnership helped them to defeat a dejected Woods and the American rookie Bryson DeChambeau by a convincing 5-4.
Woods, who was not particularly impressive in the two matches on Saturday, had occasional flashes of brilliance, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 fourballs and foursomes matches, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who was rested for the morning foursomes, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the world &apos; s No. 1 and No. 3 players, 2 and 1.
Although the day was pleasant and calm in the south-west of Paris, Europe did not have everything its own way.
Three-time winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas provided the Americans with a reference point, with two points on Saturday.
They won an exciting victory 2 and 1 against Ian Poulter and Spanish player Jon Rahm in the fourballs and then defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 and 3 in the foursomes after losing the first two holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, a team has come back from a four-point deficit in the singles only twice, but Furyk, as the holder of the trophy, only needs a tie to retain it.
Although they were the second best for two days, it seems that mounting a counter-attack on Sunday is beyond their capabilities.
North Korea says there is &quot; no possibility &quot; of unilateral disarmament if there is no confidence
On Saturday, the Foreign Minister of North Korea informed the United Nations that the continuation of the sanctions deepened his distrust of the United States and that there was no possibility of his country unilaterally giving up its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho declared to the General Assembly of the international agency that North Korea had taken &quot; important goodwill measures &quot; over the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear test facilities and committing to nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear technology.
However, we did not receive any similar response from the United States.
If we do not have confidence in the United States, we cannot have confidence in our national security, and in those circumstances there is no possibility of us unilaterally disarming.
While Ri repeated the North &apos; s well-known complaints about Washington &apos; s resistance to a &quot; phased &quot; denuclearization formula that rewards the country as it takes steps in a gradual manner, his statement is important, as he did not reject unilateral denuclearization outright, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri made reference to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump following the first summit between an American president in office and a North Korean leader on 12 June in Singapore, when Kim committed to working towards &quot; denuclearization of the Korean peninsula &quot; and Trump guaranteed the security of North Korea.
North Korea has pursued the official end of the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also resisted calls to soften international sanctions against North Korea.
The United States has insisted on denuclearization first and has increased pressure through sanctions in order to achieve its purpose by force, even objecting to a declaration of the end of the war, Ri said.
The idea that sanctions can make us fall to our knees is a fantasy of people who do not know us.
The problem is that the continuation of the sanctions deepens our mistrust.
Ri made no mention of the plans for a second Trump-Kim summit, announced by the United States leader to the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the minister emphasized three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months, and added: "If South Korea had been the party interested in denuclearization instead of the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be in such a stalemate."
Even so, the tone of Ri’s speech was radically different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to direct North Korean missiles towards US soil after the “malign” Trump, on a suicidal mission, called Kim “rocket man.”
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to &quot; totally destroy &quot; North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in moving towards disarmament, but said that much more needed to be done and that sanctions must be maintained until North Korea denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no deadline for this: "We can take two years, three years, five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its progress.
However, as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: &quot; The imposition of Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without waiver until we realize the full and verified denuclearization &quot;.
The Security Council has imposed sanctions on North Korea since 2006, in an attempt to cut off funding for Pyongyang &apos; s ballistic and nuclear missile programmes.
Pompeo chatted with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and later commented that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not a success.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, but North Korea denounced its &quot; demands as those of a gangster &quot; only a few hours later.
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States implemented “appropriate measures.”
He said that Kim had told him that the &quot; corresponding measures &quot; he was seeking were the security guarantees that Trump had promised in Singapore and steps towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to get enough sleep
Thanks to a new course being offered this year at Harvard University, all university students are now sleeping more in an attempt to combat the growing macho culture of staying up all night drinking coffee.
One professor found that students at the world &apos; s top university had little idea of basic self-care.
The course, believed to be the first of its kind in the United States, was designed by Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at the Harvard Medical School, and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital.
The motivation for starting the course came after a talk on how sleep deprivation affects learning.
At the end of the course, a girl came up to me and asked why she was only hearing about this now, in her final year.
He said that no one had ever spoken to him about the importance of sleep, which surprised me.
The course, which was introduced this year, explains to students the basic concepts of how good sleep habits contribute to academic and athletic performance, as well as to overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a psychiatrist at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university &apos; s health services, said that the university had decided to introduce the course after discovering that students were sleeping only a few hours a week.
The one-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is an image of a bedroom, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sports shoes and books that inform them of the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of lack of sleep on athletic performance and the importance of establishing a bedtime routine.
In another section, participants are informed of how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Then, an icon of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
We know that it will not change the behaviour of students overnight.
However, we believe that they have a right to know, just as anyone has a right to know the health effects of smoking tobacco,” added Professor Czeisler.
He stated that the culture of &quot; pulling an all-nighter &quot; still exists and added that modern technology and the increasing pressure on students mean that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Sleeping enough and getting good quality sleep should be 'the secret weapon' of students to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety; even to avoid gaining weight, as sleep deprivation makes the brain feel hungry, so they are always hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemistry and physics, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes the previous year during his first year at Harvard.
He noted that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to expand it to the entire campus.
He hoped that the next step would be to ask all graduate students to complete a similar course before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler &apos; s recommendation is that students set an alarm to go to bed and another to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of the blue light emitted by electrical appliances and LED screens, which can disrupt circadian rhythms, and thus have problems falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - Rangers 0: Menga's goal knocks out Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another home defeat, when the Dolly Menga attack saw the disjointed Steven Gerrard team go down 1-0 to Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to get their first away win since the 4-1 triumph at St. Johnstone on 2 February, but Gary Holt &apos; s team defeated Gerrard &apos; s for the second time in 18 games as manager, leaving his team eight points behind Premiership leaders Hearts.
Menga's attack came just minutes before half-time and Rangers' lacklustre formation was never in the game.
Now Rangers go down to the sixth position, Livingston go up to the third, behind Hibs by the goal difference.
The Rangers may have more problems, as referee Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after an object was allegedly thrown from the visiting team's end.
Gerrard changed eight of the players who won the game against Ayr, entering the semi-finals of the Scottish League Cup.
For their part, Holt was delighted with the way his Livingston team, who won 1-0 against Hearts last week, dominated the game from start to finish.
The Rangers may have had more possession, but Livingston made better use of the ball when they had it.
They should have marked the two minutes of the start, when Menga made a pass into space for Scott Pittman, who was left alone in front of Allan McGregor, but the midfield player sent her out.
Keaghan Jacobs gave a penalty for Captain Craig Halket, but his partner in defence, Alan Lithgow, could only send it out for the long pole.
The Rangers regained control, but it seemed that there was more hope than conviction in their play in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he had been penalised in the 15th minute of the match, when he and Steven Lawless clashed, but referee Steven Thomson ignored his request.
Rangers got two shots on target in the first half, but former Ibrox keeper Liam Kelly barely had a save to make as Lassana Coulibaly's header and Ovie Ejaria's long-range effort were both easily dealt with.
Although Livingston's goal in the 34th minute was against all the odds, nobody can deny that they deserved it for the effort they put in.
Again, Rangers were unable to cope with a deep ball from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher played the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his cool and passed it to Menga to mark the goal.
In the break, Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, and almost immediately the ball was played into Morelos, but the impressive Kelly came out of his line to block it.
Still, Livingston kept the visitors exactly where he wanted them, with Lithgow and Halkett clearing out long passes after long passes.
Holt could have taken more advantage in the final stages, but McGregor held firm to deny Jacobs before Lithgow headed a corner that did not come off.
Rangers substitute Glen Middleton claimed a penalty in the closing stages after a tussle with Jacobs, but again Thomson looked the other way.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, a page from the Almanac section of 'Sunday Morning': 30 September 1882, 136 years ago, and counting... the future physical Johannes Wilhelm 'Hans' Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention culminating in the device known as the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter, which has since become a pillar of science, also became a pillar of pop culture, as in the 1950 film &quot; The Bells of Coronado &quot;, with actors Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in the apparently incompatible roles of cowboy scientists:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: 'It is a Geiger counter, it is used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on the headphones, you can hear the effect of the radioactivity emitted by the minerals.”
Evans: 'It's like a radio!'
Hans Geiger died in 1945, at the age of 63.
But the invention for which his name is given is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to &quot; see &quot; malignant cells and kill them.
As part of the treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells.
The method requires the extraction of immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory.
They can "see" a common protein in many cancers and re-inject it.
A trial of the vaccine is generating promising results in patients with different cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method requires the extraction of immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory so that they can &quot; see &quot; a common protein called HER2, and then re-injecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, commented: 'Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.'
HER2 &quot; promotes growth of different types of cancer, such as breast, ovarian, lung or colorectal cancer, &quot; explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach of taking immune cells from patients and "teaching" them to attack cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West went on a Trump rant with a MAGA hat after his SNL appearance.
It did not work out.
Kanye West was booed in the Saturday Night Live studio after a shaky performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for president in 2020.
After the third song of the night, called Ghost Town, during which he wore the hat with the message Make America Great Again, he began to rant against Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
I often speak to white people and they ask me how I can like Trump, who is racist.
Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago, he said.
SNL began the program with a sketch featuring Matt Damon mocking Brett Kavanaugh &apos; s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding Christine Blasey Ford &apos; s sexual assault allegations.
Although the footage was not aired, comedian Chris Rock posted the footage of West &apos; s rant on social media.
It was not clear whether Rock was trying to ridicule West in the publication.
In addition, West told the audience that he had had a hard time backstage because of the hat.
They messed with me.
They told me not to wear my hat.
They were messing with me!
And then they say I am asleep,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: 'Do you want to see me asleep?' and added: 'I'm going to put on my superman cape, because that means nobody can tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?'
Try with love.”
His comments were booed by the audience at least twice, and members of SNL appeared to be embarrassed, according to Variety, which reported that "the studio went completely silent."
West had been invited to replace the singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West shocked many when he came on stage to sing I Love it dressed as a bottle of Perrier.
West was supported by the leader of the Conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: &quot; One of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR RESISTING THE MASSES.
Karen Hunter, a talk show host, tweeted that West was &quot; just being himself and that is absolutely wonderful &quot;.
I choose not to reward someone (by buying their music or clothes, or supporting their art) whom I consider to be embracing and spreading a dangerous ideology for my community.
He is free.
We too,” he added.
Before the programme, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now &quot; the person formerly known as Kanye West &quot;.
It is not the first artist to change his name, following in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague Snoop Dogg has also been known as Snoop Lion, without forgetting the legendary musician Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist formerly known as Prince.
Attempted murder by stabbing in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.

The accused is expected to appear in Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The prosecution will review the charges.
Kit Harington, Game of Thrones star, attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his role as Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones on HBO.
The actor, 31, has attacked the stereotype of the male hero, saying that such roles on screen often told young boys that they had to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit commented that &quot; something went wrong &quot; and questioned how to address the issue of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit Harrington, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he thought it &quot; quite important &quot; to address the issue.
“Personally, I think that is quite important at the moment, 'Where have we gone wrong with masculinity?' he commented.
What have we been teaching men as they grew up, thinking of the problems that are now?
Kit believes that television can have some responsibility for the growing toxic masculinity due to its very masculine characters.
He continued: &quot; What is innate and what is taught?
What is being taught on television and in the street that makes young people feel that they have to be this particular kind of man?
I think that is one of the great questions of our time: how do we change it?
Because it is clear that something has gone wrong in the education of young people.
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not be involved in any prequels or sequels to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, saying that he is &quot; tired of battlefields and horses &quot;.
In November, Kit will star in True West, the play by Sam Shepard, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that he believes getting to know his wife Rose is the best thing he got out of Game of Thrones.
I met my wife on the show, so in that sense, she has given my future family and my life from now on.
Rose represented Ygritte, the love interest of Kit Harrington &apos; s character Jon Snow in the fantasy series which won an Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 at a farm belonging to Leslie &apos; s family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14 per cent more new cases
China has announced an increase of 14 per cent in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820,000 people affected in the country, according to the health authorities.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, some 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of these were sexually transmitted, a change from the past.
HIV traditionally spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people contracting HIV in this way has been reduced to a practical zero, Chinese health authorities declared at a congress in the province of Yunnan.
Every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increases by about 100,000.
HIV transmission through sexual intercourse is a serious problem in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality had been decriminalized in China in 1997, but the LGBT community faced much discrimination.
Because of the country &apos; s conservative values, studies have estimated that between 70 and 90 per cent of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the diseases are transmitted by not using adequate protection in these relations.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has pledged universal access to HIV medicines as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of her staff leaked information about Republican senators and accuses it of “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories.”
Representative Maxine Waters criticized the allegations that a member of her staff had posted personal information of three United States Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of legislators on Saturday.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that those allegations were being pushed by commentators and websites on the &quot; far right &quot;.
“Lies, lies and more vile lies,” Waters commented on Twitter.
The information published reportedly included the addresses and telephone numbers of United States Senators Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
On Thursday, an unknown person in the Capitol posted the information on the Internet during a Senate panel hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred sometime after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the origin of the publications was associated with Waters &apos; office and released the data of a Waters staff member, according to Capitol.
This baseless accusation is completely false and a complete lie, continued Waters.
The member of my staff whose identity, personal data and security have been affected as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations was not responsible for the leak of this information.
This baseless allegation is completely false and a complete lie.
Waters &apos; statement drew immediate criticism on the Internet, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
Fleischer wrote that he &quot; flatly denied &quot; the report.
This suggests that the necessary temperance to be a Member of Congress is lacking.
When someone is accused of something that he did not do, he should not get angry.
It must not rebel.
It should not question the motives of the prosecutor.
You must remain calm and serene.
It seems that Fleischer wanted to compare Waters &apos; reaction to the Democrats &apos; criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by detractors of appearing too angry during his testimony on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is trying to unseat Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
If true, that was very serious, he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said that his office had alerted &quot; the relevant authorities and law enforcement entities to these fraudulent allegations &quot;.
We will ensure that the perpetrators are identified and held legally accountable for all these destructive and dangerous actions against all my staff members.
Johnny English: Again on the case. Rowan Atkinson's spoof spy is outdone
It has now become a tradition to look for Brexit gags in any new film with a British approach. It seems that this is what we should do with this new Johnny English franchise, which started in 2003 with Johnny English and returned in 2011 with Johnny English Returns.
Will this ironic self-criticism about how clearly ridiculous we are be the new export opportunity for the nation?
In any case, Johnny English, with his bulging eyes and expressionless face, has renewed his licence to make a fool of himself for the second time. His name alone gives clues that this is a comic creation aimed at territories with non-English-speaking film audiences.
Of course, it is the ridiculous secret agent who, despite his strange claims to glamour, has a little bit of Clouseau, a touch of Mr Bean and a pinch of that sort of thing that touched on the subject of the Cars film at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
In addition, it was originally based on the mysterious man traveller and international represented years ago by Atkinson in the now forgotten Barclaycard television adverts, leaving chaos in his wake.
There are one or two good moments in this last instalment.
I loved seeing Johnny English approaching a helicopter in full medieval armour, with the rotors smashing into the hull.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is evident, but the humour is rather short and strangely superfluous, especially now that franchises such as James Bond and Mission Impossible add comic ingredients without any problems.
The humour seems to be aimed at children rather than adults, and for me the absurd mishaps of Johnny English are not as clever and as funny as the silent jokes of Atkinson in the role of Mr Bean.
The current argument of the hour is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A computer hacker has infiltrated the super-secret British spy network, revealing the identities of all active agents to the consternation of the agent on duty, a sadly small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the final straw for the Prime Minister, a pompous and cornered figure who is seeing her political popularity sink: Emma Thompson gives her best in this role, which is almost like Theresa May, but the script does not leave much room for manoeuvre.
His intelligence advisers inform him that, as all active spies are in danger, he will have to call on one who is retired.
That is Johnny English, who is now teaching at a posh school, although he is giving unofficial lessons on how to be a secret agent: there are some good jokes, as it is a spy school like the one in Rock School.
Es is moved to Whitehall for an urgent meeting and meets his old pal Bough, represented once again by Ben Miller.
Now Bough is a married man with a submariner captain, a role that Vicki Pepperdine does not exploit enough.
Thus, the Batman and Robin who do things terribly wrong in the Secret Service of the Queen are back in action, with the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is falling into the dangerous clutches of a charismatic multi-millionaire from the world of technology who claims he can solve Britain's IT problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of absurd situations: they disguise themselves as waiters, set fire to a chic French restaurant, cause chaos by hiding on the luxurious yacht of Volta; and English becomes pure anarchy when he tries to use a virtual reality helmet to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta &apos; s house.
The last sequence was definitely well used, but, however graceful and noisy it may be, the whole thing still conveys a somewhat childish feeling.
A fairly regular product.
Like the other Johnny English films, I could not help wondering whether the British film industry could not give Rowan Atkinson a role that would do justice to his talent.
The Labour Party denies that it is planning to make Britons work four days a week and get paid for five
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbyn will think about a radical plan with which the British would work four days a week, but get paid for five.
The party allegedly wants the owners of companies to allocate the savings made possible by the AI revolution to the workers, giving them an extra day off.
Thus, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend for the same pay.
According to sources, the idea &quot; fits &quot; into the party &apos; s economic plans and agenda and would tilt the country in favour of workers.
This change to a four-day week has been supported by the Congress of Trade Unions, as it is a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
As a senior Labour Party figure commented to The Sunday Times: a review of the directive is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
"The four-day week will not be achieved overnight, but it is definitely a matter that the party hopes to incorporate in order to rebalance the economy in favour of the worker, as well as in the overall industrial strategy of the party."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this kind of idea, as the Green Party already promised a four-day working week in its campaign for the 2017 general election.
However, at the moment, not all of the Labour Party is behind this decision.
A Labour spokesman said: 'The four-day working week is not part of the party's policy and is not going to be discussed at this stage.'
The shadow Chancellor, John McDonnell, used the Labour Party conference last week to outline his idea of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said that he was prepared to restore powers of "anonymous" and "self-interested" directors of companies providing public services.
One of the shadow minister's plans also includes the idea that the current shareholders in water companies should not get back all their shares, since a Labour government could apply deductions to match the perceived irregularities.
It also confirmed its intention to include workers on company boards and to create inclusive ownership funds to which 10 per cent of shares in private sector companies would be allocated, with workers receiving annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk about the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh and whether it could change their minds
The FBI investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his confirmation as a Supreme Court judge by at least a week, and raises the question of whether the results could influence any Republican Senator who might ultimately decide to withdraw his support.
In an interview to be broadcast on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could produce information that would change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
Of course, Kennedy said.
I was in favour of proceeding with the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after all this had happened, after the allegation had come out, and I asked him: 'Did you do it?'
He was firm, resolute, decisive."
Graham's vote, however, seems immovable.
I have already made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh and I would just ignore the accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett flatly denied it," Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And none of the persons she names has been able to confirm it.
Thirty-six years ago.
It is always the same, I see nothing new in this case."
What is the 'Global Citizen Festival'? Has it reduced poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music festival, where an impressive roster of stars will come together for an equally impressive mission: to end poverty in the world.
This year, in its seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people flock to Central Park &apos; s Great Lawn to enjoy performances by Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event &apos; s real goal: ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international awareness group that aims to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively working to end it.
In order to receive a free entry to the event (unless they can afford a VIP ticket), concert-goers have had to complete a series of tasks or “actions,” such as volunteering, sending an email to a global leader, making a phone call or any other activity that raises awareness of their goal to end poverty.
However, what has Global Citizen achieved in 12 years of reaching its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way of persuading people to take action or is it just a form of 'clicktivism', the term used to describe the position we take when we think we are doing something really useful by signing a petition online or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has claimed to have registered more than 19 million "actions" by its supporters in support of a wide range of goals.
Through these actions, they claim to have secured commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion from global leaders, which will impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
By early 2018, the group had cited 390 commitments and announcements that had emerged from its actions, of which at least $10 billion had already been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that the guaranteed funds have directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Among the most important commitments is "The Power of Nutrition," a partnership of investors and implementers based in the United Kingdom, united by a common commitment to "help children grow and develop to their full potential." To that end, they have proposed to provide $35 million to help end malnutrition in Rwanda, following more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens partners.
Thanks to the support of the Government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and Global Citizens partners like you, we can make a small but significant step in the history of social injustice of malnutrition," said Tracey Ullman, ambassador for "The Power of Nutrition," to a crowd during a concert in April 2018 in London.
The group also stated that, after more than 5,000 actions to improve nutrition for mothers and children in the United Kingdom, the Government announced funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, which will benefit 5 million women and children through nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on our website about what we think can be done to address extreme poverty,
One Global Citizen partner responded: &quot; It will be a long and hard road and we will stumble and fall many times.
But, as the human rights and anti-apartheid movements have already shown, we will succeed in our aims, because we are stronger together.
Performers at this year &apos; s New York event include Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe, among others, to be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US could use the Navy to implement the energy export embargo on Russia - Interior Secretariat
In the event that it is necessary, the United States could call upon its Navy to prevent Russian energy from shaking up markets, including the Middle East, according to United States Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke, as reported by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia &apos; s alliance with Syria, particularly where it operates at the behest of the legitimate government, is just a pretext for expansion into new markets.
I am convinced that they are in the Middle East to negotiate with energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, becoming the supplier to the south of Europe," he said.
In addition, according to official information, there are ways and methods of dealing with this issue.
The United States, with its Navy, has the ability to ensure that shipping lanes remain open and, if necessary, could even block them to ensure that energy does not end up on the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the people who attended an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that describes itself as "the voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
In it, he compared the approaches that Washington takes in its negotiations with Russia and Iran, and noted that they are, in fact, the same.
The economic alternative in Iran and Russia is, essentially, to exploit and replace fuels," he warned, while indicating that Russia is only capable of doing one thing, which is to base its economy on fossil fuels.
These statements are made at a time when the Trump administration has been trying to push its liquefied natural gas exports to Europe and to take Russia off the hook, which is the cheapest option for European consumers.
To this end, members of the Trump administration, including Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to abandon the 'inappropriate' Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which, according to Trump, will make Berlin a hostage to Moscow.
Moscow has consistently insisted that the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which is worth $11 billion and is intended to double the existing pipeline's capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin defends the fact that Washington &apos; s vehement opposition to the project is motivated only by economic considerations and is yet another example of unfair competition.
I believe that we all share the idea that energy cannot be a tool of pressure and that consumers must be able to choose their suppliers," said the Russian Minister of Energy, Alexander Novak, after a meeting with Rick Perry, the US Secretary of Energy, in Moscow last September.
The United States position has, however, been met with a rejection by Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The German industry leader, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has asked the United States not to intervene in EU energy policy or in the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
It is a major problem when a third state interferes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, director of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will be considering running for President in 2020, says Massachusetts Senator Warren
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would consider running for president after the midterm elections.
During a visit to the Holyoke City Hall in Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that this challenge was being considered.
It is time for women to come to Washington to mend our fractured government and to finally have women in leadership," she said, according to The Hill.
After 6 November, I will seriously consider standing for the presidency.
Warren gave his opinion on President Donald Trump during a speech at the Town Hall and said that "he was taking the country down the wrong path."
I am really concerned about the damage that Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren spoke openly about Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet from last Friday, Warren stated that 'it is absolutely necessary for the FBI to investigate what happened before the vote.'
A poll was published on Thursday, but a majority of Warren's own voters do not believe she should run for re-election in 2020.
A 58% of "potential" voters in Massachusetts said that Senator Kerry should not run, according to a Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
Some 32 per cent of those surveyed did, however, support his candidacy.
The poll showed increased support for former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent support for a possible candidacy and 48 per cent against.
Other recognized members of the Democratic Party spoke about the possible candidacy for 2020 of former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
Biden said he would make a formal decision in January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about Track Palin &apos; s post-traumatic stress disorder at a Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence last Monday night.
"The situation that my son is going through, everything that has happened since he returned, you know it well, the other families that suffer the effects of TETRA and other wounds that our soldiers return with," she said to the crowd gathered at a rally in support of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin referred to this arrest as the great taboo that nobody wants to talk about, and commented on her son and other war veterans who "come back with a different attitude, hardened, wondering if there is really that respect for what their fellow soldiers and aviators, as well as all the other members of the army, have given to their country."
On Monday, he was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, on charges of domestic violence against a woman, which interfered with a domestic violence complaint and possession of firearms under the influence of drugs or alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 States, D.C. support the challenge to develop a new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to the new United States policy denying asylum to victims of domestic violence or gang violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and the District of Columbia filed a "friendly" brief in Washington on Friday to show their support for an asylum-seeker who is facing the current directive, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the case "Grace v. Sessions" which was filed by the US Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) in August against the federal policy has not been revealed.
She said that her partner and his children, who were members of a violent gang, had abused her, but the United States officials had denied her asylum request on 20 July.
He was arrested in Texas.
The lawyers representing these states, who are defending Grace, described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum applications to the United States, as nations facing widespread problems related to domestic and gang violence.
The new US asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) that undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence could apply for asylum in the United States.
The Attorney General of the District of Columbia, Karl Racine, made statements on Friday in which he claimed that the new policy "ignores decades of international, federal and state law."
According to federal law, all asylum applications must be decided on the particular facts and circumstances of the application, and this exception violates that principle," the amicus curiae states.
The lawyers also indicated in their brief that the policy of denying entry to immigrants is detrimental to the United States economy, as they claim that immigrants are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide a needed workforce."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to domestic violence and gang violence victims in June.
"Individuals who leave their countries of origin because of persecution or threats of persecution on the basis of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion may apply for asylum," Sessions said when he announced this directive on 11 June.
Asylum was never created as a measure to alleviate all problems, let alone all serious problems, that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death toll mounts in race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was becoming increasingly dire.
The situation is very tense," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, as she tried to comfort her feverish baby in a relief centre in the devastated city of Palu.
Every minute, ambulances arrive with more bodies.
And clean water is scarce."
Some residents have returned to their destroyed homes to search through the few belongings that remain to them in an effort to recover what they can.
Hundreds of people are injured and hospitals, which were also damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake, are overwhelmed.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who had broken his back and his shoulder, were resting outside the Army Hospital in Palu, where patients were being treated outside the building because of the continuing strong aftershocks.
I could not help but cry when he told us about the violent earthquake he experienced while he was on the fifth floor of the hotel with his wife and daughter.
We had no time to get out of the way.
I was trapped in the rubble, I think," Haris told Associated Press. He and his family were in the city to celebrate a wedding.
I heard my wife call for help and then a terrible silence.
I do not know what has happened to her and my daughter.
I hope you are well."
US ambassador accuses China of "bullying" with "propaganda announcements"
A week after a four-page advertisement in an American newspaper by a Chinese official newspaper promoting the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the United States ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
Last Wednesday, the United States President, Donald Trump, referred to the China Daily supplement in the Des Moines Register, the most-read newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of trying to interfere in the United States Congress elections on 6 November, something China denies vehemently.
The accusation that Trump launched against Beijing &apos; s attempt to influence the US elections marked what US officials told Reuters as a new phase in a growing campaign by Washington to pressure China.
While it is common for foreign governments to issue advertisements to promote their commercial activities, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in a growing trade war that has led to an increase in tariff levels on imports by both sides.
China &apos; s countervailing duties that were in place at the start of the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states like Iowa, which supported the Republican Party of Donald Trump, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, the United States ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, one of the largest agricultural exporters to China, said that Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesspeople.
As Branstad wrote in an opinion piece in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, China "is intensifying that pressure with advertisements in our free press."
"In an attempt to spread its propaganda, the Chinese government is using the precious American tradition of free speech and press to try to place a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
In contrast, in the newsstand on the street where we are in Beijing, only a few dissenting voices are heard and no real reflection of the diverse opinions that people in China can have on the worrying trajectory that the economy of their country is taking, as the media are controlled by the strong pressure of the Chinese Communist Party."
He added that "one of the most relevant newspapers in China refused to publish" his article, but did not specify which newspaper.
Analysts note that Republicans are distancing themselves from women before the midterm election with the Kavanaugh debacle
As many prominent Republicans are rallying behind Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of various sexual assault allegations, analysts have warned that a backlash, especially among women, could occur in the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions surrounding this event have been very intense and many Republicans have stated that they want to proceed with the vote.
Grant Reeher, a political science professor at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, told The Hill in an article published Saturday that &quot; this is not a subject that can be reversed &quot;.
Reeher said he doubted that the latest attempt by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to position himself in favour of the FBI investigation would be enough to calm disgruntled voters on this issue.
Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday; they are not going to forget tomorrow or in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, according to the Washington, D.C., newspaper.
On Friday morning, the protesters who gathered at the Senate doors were chanting "November is coming!" (November will come soon!) as the Republicans on the Judiciary Committee decided to move forward with the nomination of Judge Kavanaugh, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, as reported by Mic.
The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats is off the charts," said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst, to the news site.
People say that the impact is already very significant and, indeed, it is.
But it could even be higher, especially among indecisive women in the suburbs and younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who do not usually vote, even if they do not like the President."
Even before Ford &apos; s public testimony detailing her allegations of sexual abuse by the Supreme Court nominee, analysts had indicated that a reversal was possible if the Republicans pressed ahead with the confirmation.
This has become a big mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, as early as last week, according to NBC News.
It is not just about the committee vote and the final vote, or even whether they sit on the bench with Kavanaugh; it is also about how the Republicans have handled this and how they have treated her," said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats.
However, the Americans seem to be divided; they do not know who to believe after the testimonies of Ford and Kavanaugh, although a few more are siding with Kavanaugh.
In a new YouGov poll, 41% of respondents say they believe Ford &apos; s testimony definitively or probably, while 35% say they believe Kavanaugh &apos; s testimony definitively or probably.
In addition, 38 per cent said they thought Kavanaugh was likely or definitely lying during his testimony, while 30 per cent said the same of Ford.
Following the push by Flake, the FBI is currently investigating Ford &apos; s statements, as well as at least those of another accuser, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford testified under oath to the Senate Judiciary Committee last week and indicated that Kavanaugh raped her while she was drunk at age 17.
Ramirez, for his part, alleged that the candidate for the Supreme Court showed him his genitals at a party when he was at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is considering starting a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a new company that is trying to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt is the latest project from the technology legend. A company based on the open-source Berners-Lee Solid code platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and who will have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is "to rule the world."
He said that it must be now on startup.
It is a historic moment.
The application uses the Solid technology to allow users to create their own "online personal data store" or POD.
It can contain lists, lists of tasks to be completed, the calendar, the music library and other personal and professional tools.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in one browser and at the same time.
One thing that is unique to online personal data storage is that the user decides completely who can access what type of information.
The company calls it 'personal training through data'.
The idea of Inrupt, according to the company &apos; s chief executive officer, John Bruce, is to integrate the resources, processes and skills necessary for Solid to reach everyone.
The company is currently made up of Tim Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform that IBM bought, some of the developers on staff who were hired to work on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized apps with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to 'Facebook and Google about whether they are going to introduce a radical change where all their business models are completely changed overnight.
We are not going to ask for permission.
In a Medium post on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote about Inrupt that "its mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web created in Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by founding the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has had a very influential role in the debate on network neutrality.
Even as he launches Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
I am incredibly optimistic about this next era of the web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: The Clergyman Who Won a Victoria Cross in the First World War
The only Church of England clergyman to win a Victoria Cross during the First World War has been honoured in his home town 100 years later.
Lt-Col. Rev. Bernard Vann received this decoration on 29 September 1918 at the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was shot by a sniper four days later and never knew that he had been awarded the highest British military honour.
On Saturday, his two grandchildren found a commemorative stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of them, Michael Vann, said it was "a particularly symbolic" discovery that the stone was found exactly 100 years after the battle that earned his grandfather the medal.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the St. Quentin Canal "through a dense fog and under heavy machine-gun and artillery fire."
He then ran to the firing line and, with "greatest courage," advanced the line before reaching a single-handed gun and knocking down three of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, just one month after the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather &apos; s actions were &quot; so great that I will never be able to reach his level, but they were very inspiring &quot;.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid a wreath after the parade, which was attended by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "it was a privilege for him to be able to take part in the parade" and added that "the value of a true hero is made clear when he is shown such overwhelming support."
MMA fans stayed up all night for Bellator 206, but they only saw Peppa Pig
Imagine staying up all night to watch Bellator 206 only to be denied the main event.
The San José billboard had 13 fights, six of which were on the main card, and it was to be broadcast live on Channel 5 in the United Kingdom that night.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to fight, viewers in the United Kingdom were stunned when the programme changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were not surprised after having to stay up until the early hours of the morning to watch the fight.
A Twitter follower described the change to cartoons as "a bad joke."
There is government regulation of the content that is broadcast after 6 a.m. and that content was not appropriate, so they had to switch to children's programming," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice-president of marketing and communications at Bellator, when asked about the broadcast.
""Peppa the pig", yes."
The president of Bellator, Scott Coker, said that they will be modifying the programme to include British viewers in the next editions.
When I think of the option of a replay, I think it can work," said Coker.
But it is at 6 a.m. on a Sunday, so we could not do it until Sunday at our time, which would be Monday for them.
We are seeing how to do that.
Believe me, when the programming was changed, a great many messages were received, and not all of them were friendly.
We are trying to sort it out, because we thought it was a technical problem at first.
But that was not the case, it was a government problem.
I can promise that this will not happen again.
We will reduce it to five fights instead of six, which is the normal number we have had, and we tried to give more than usual so that the fans were happy and we were happy.
It is a very unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior because of his sexuality, but this was what motivated him to become a winner.
At 24, he told us that he did not realize until he went to secondary school that "not everyone was like me."
In the first Desert Island Discs programme on Radio 4, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said that his intention in talking about gay rights was to 'give hope' to others.
He also told us that becoming a father made him start to take less importance in winning at the Olympics.
The presenter of this mythical programme, Kirsty Young, is going to be absent for a few months because of illness.
In the first Laverne programme, Daley, who had himself been an outcast, commented that he had felt "inferior" to the rest of the children during his childhood because "socially it was not acceptable to like boys and girls."
He said: "Until today, that sense of inferiority and difference has been what has really given me the power and strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he claimed, so he was not disappointed when he finally discovered his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a prominent face of the LGBT movement and his image has been used to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality at this year &apos; s Commonwealth Games in Australia.
He said he told his story because he felt fortunate to live in freedom, without reprisal, and wanted to share that "hope" with others.
The three-time world champion declared that for him too it was a big surprise to fall in love with a man, the American film director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married last year to an Oscar winner, who is 20 years older, although he specified that the age difference had never been an issue.
When you live so long from such a young age (she was at her first Olympics at 14 and her father died of cancer three years later), it is hard to find someone of the same age who has gone through the same highs and lows as you.
The couple had a son in June, whom they named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that his "global perspective" had changed.
If I had been asked last year, all the answers would have been 'I have to win a gold medal'," he said.
But you know what, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My gold Olympic medal is, without doubt, Robbie's."
His son is named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept that he was going to die and, indeed, one of the last things he asked was whether they had their tickets for London 2012, because he wanted to be in the front row.
I was not able to tell him that I could not be in the front row," he recounted.
He had his hand in mine when he stopped breathing and it was only at that precise moment when he stopped breathing and died that I realized that he was not invincible," he commented.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
I knew then that this was what I had dreamed of all my life: to swim in front of my family in an Olympic Games, there was nothing better," he said.
This was also the inspiration behind her first choice of song, Proud, by Heather Small, which accompanied her during the preparation for the Olympic Games.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 BST.
Mickelson, in poor form, was on the bench for the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th match in the Ryder Cup, but he will have to reverse his form if he is to avoid becoming a sad milestone.
Mickelson, playing in the event that is held every two years to break a record for the 12th time, was beaten by captain Furyk for the Saturday fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the centre of the action, as it has so often been for the United States, the five-time major champion had to settle for cheering at times and, at others, trying to improve his game on the field and thus rectify his woes.
Never the most direct of drivers, even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old player is not in his best form for Le Golf National, where the long rough continually punishes errant shots.
And if the field is not sufficiently discouraging, Mickelson, in the ninth round on Sunday, faces the brilliant Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has joined debutant Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans, who were four points down at the start of the 12 individual matches, had started in such an impressive manner, Mickelson's match might have been decisive.
Furyk showed confidence in his partner, but he could say no more.
He understood perfectly the role he had today, he patted me on the back and said he would be ready tomorrow," said Furyk.
He is very self-assured.
He is in the Hall of Fame and has contributed a lot to these teams before and this week.
I probably did not imagine playing two games.
I thought it would be more, but that is how it came out and that is how we think it should be.
He wants to be there, like the rest of them."
On Sunday, Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo &apos; s record of most matches played in the Ryder Cup.
It could be the last of a whole Ryder Cup career that never matched its own individual brand levels so clearly.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and 7 ties, but Furyk said his presence added many more intangible values to the team.
He is fun, sarcastic, clever, likes to mock others; he is great to have on the team," he explained.
I think the younger players have really enjoyed having him as support, this week as well; it was fun.
It is much more than just a game."
The European captain, Thomas Bjorn, knows that leadership can disappear very quickly
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows very well that, although he has a substantial lead going into the last few days of the Ryder Cup, he can easily turn it into an uncomfortable tournament.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where a Seve Ballesteros-led team held a five-point lead over the Americans, but in the end they only managed to win by a minimum margin, 14½-13½.
"You keep reminding me that we had a great tournament at Valderrama; we also had one at Brookline and lost, we had one at Valderrama and won, but by a whisker," Bjorn said, after seeing the 2018 generation win 5-3 on Friday and lead by 10-6 yesterday at Le Golf National.
History will teach me and everyone else that this team is not finished.
You have to give it your all tomorrow.
Get out of here and do what you have to do.
This does not stop until the points are on the board.
We have a target to achieve, which is to win this trophy, and that is all we have to think about.
I say this all the time, I focus on the 12 players on our team, but we are very aware of what is on the other side where they are, not one or two, but the best players in the world."
Proud of what his players had done on a very tough golf course, Bjorn added: "I wouldn &apos; t want to get ahead of myself.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
What is important tomorrow is individual action, and that is different.
It is great to share what is happening with a partner when things are going well, but when you are alone, you are really testing your golfing ability.
That is the message that has to be sent to the players, to get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now it is time to leave your partner behind and go and get the best out of yourself."
Facing Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will be hoping that his players can do better individually than they did as a team, with Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas the exceptions, who added three points to four.
Furyk has been on both ends of the spectrum in the last few days of these great tournaments and was part of the winning team at Brookline and then lost when Europe pulled off the "Miracle at Medinah."
He remembered every word, when we asked him how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, managed to motivate his players on the last day.
We have 12 super-majorities tomorrow, but we have to start as well as we did in Brookline, as you saw in Medinah.
When we all move in the same direction, all the pressure falls on these middle parties.
We defined our strategy and made them feel that we were going to try to do something magical tomorrow."
We have given Thomas the task of trying to lead the fight and take on Rory McIlroy in the main event, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the second half of the field.
I went with this group of boys in this order because I think they cover the whole trip," said Bjorn on his individual selections.
The new German frigate, postponed again
The new frigate for the German Navy was to have been ordered in 2014 to replace the old Cold War-era vessels, but would not be delivered until at least next year due to defective systems and the increasing costs, local media reported.
The delivery of the "Rheinland-Pfalz," the lead ship of the new Baden-Württemberg-class frigates, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to a statement by a military spokesman cited by the newspaper Die Zeit.
The ship was to have joined the Navy in 2014, but problems that arose after the handover scuttled the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates requested by the Navy in 2007 will replace the old Bremen class frigates.
We know that they will include a powerful gun, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-missile missiles, and some stealth technologies, such as radar, infrared and acoustic signatures, which are very low.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, so that they can be deployed for up to two years away from the ports of origin.
However, the constant delays have meant that the innovative ships (which were supposed to allow Germany to project its power into the far reaches of the world) will already be outdated when they start to be put into service, Die Zeit points out.
The unfortunate F125 frigate occupied the headlines last year, when the German Navy officially rejected the idea of putting the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm &amp; Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time that the Navy has returned a ship to an arsenal after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind the return, but German media cited a number of "critical software and hardware defects" that left the ship virtually unusable if sent to a combat mission.
The software deficiencies were particularly important, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors: half the personnel of the old Bremen class frigates.
It was also found that the ship is overweight, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the Navy to add future upgrades.
The "Rheinland-Pfalz" of 7,000 tons is believed to be twice as heavy as other similar ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to defective hardware, the price of the entire project, including crew training, has also been a problem.
It is estimated to have reached EUR 3.1 billion (USD 4.2 billion), up from the initial EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems attributed to the new frigates are of particular relevance in the light of recent warnings about the reduction of Germany's naval power.
In the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defence committee of the German parliament, admitted that the Navy is 'left without ships capable of deploying'.
The officer said that the problem had become worse over time, because old ships had been decommissioned but not replaced.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates had been able to join the Navy.
The National Trust spies on the secret lives of bats
This new research, which has been carried out in a Highland Scottish state, seeks to discover how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
It is hoped that what is learned will shed more light on the behaviour of the only flying mammals and help to guide future conservation efforts.
The study, carried out by the National Trust for Scotland, will follow common and soprano pipistrelle bats, as well as Daubenton's bat and long-eared bats of Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed in strategic locations on the property to track bat activity during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
Experts will analyse the sounds picked up in the recordings to determine the frequency of calls by bats and the species that make them.
A habitat report and map will then be produced to provide a detailed picture of the environment and its behaviour.
Rob Dewar, a nature conservation adviser for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important to bats and how they use them.
This information will identify the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of grasslands and how forests should be managed for bats and other associated species.
Bat populations in Scotland and the United Kingdom have declined considerably in the last century.
They are under threat from construction and development that affects their nests and the loss of their habitat.
Wind turbines and electrical wiring can also pose a risk to them, as can insecticides and other chemicals in building materials or attacks by domestic cats.
Bats are not really blind,
Instead, because of its nocturnal hunting habits, its ears are more useful than its eyes in achieving its goal.
They use sophisticated ecolocation techniques to locate ants and obstacles on their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes the issue of bats very seriously.
It has 10 trained experts who regularly carry out surveys, nest inspections and, on occasion, rescue operations.
The organization has even opened the first and only reserve dedicated to bats in Scotland in the state of Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, which is the home of eight of the ten species of bat in Scotland.
The owner, David Thompson, says it is the ideal territory for them.
Here at Threave we have a fantastic area for bats," he said.
We have old buildings, many veteran trees and all the right habitat.
However, there is still much that is unknown about bats, and the work that we are doing here and elsewhere will help us to understand better what they need to develop."
It stresses the importance of checking for bats before carrying out maintenance work on the property, as a colony of breeding bats could be unintentionally destroyed and 400 females and juveniles could be killed, which would wipe out an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass, disturb or destroy their colonies.
The Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, Elisabeth Ferrell, has encouraged the public to get involved.
He said: "We still have a lot to learn about bats and many other species on which we do not know how their populations are evolving."
Ronaldo denies rape allegations while his lawyers pursue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has labelled the rape allegations as 'fake news' and says that people are 'trying to get their name in the papers' at his expense.
His lawyers had been instructed to file a complaint against the German magazine Der Spiegel, which had published the statements.
The Portuguese and Juventus striker is accused of raping an American woman, called Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He is accused of having paid $375,000 to conceal the incident, according to Der Spiegel on Friday.
With an Instagram Live video that has already garnered 142 million followers just hours after the news was released, Ronaldo, 33, dismissed the report as "fake news."
No, no, no, no, no.
What you said today was false," he said, looking straight into the camera.
They just want publicity at my expense.
It is the same old story.
They want to be famous by just mentioning me, but I cannot help it.
I am a happy man and everything is fine," the player added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against Der Spiegel for the allegations that appear in what they have called "an unacceptable report of suspicions in the area of privacy," according to Reuters.
Counsel Christian Schertz said that the player would seek compensation for "moral damages for an amount that corresponds to the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of his personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident reportedly took place in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player &apos; s room and he, allegedly, raped her anally, according to documents filed in the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga stated that Ronaldo knelt down after the alleged incident and told him that he was "99 per cent" a "good boy" and that he had let him down by the remaining "one per cent."
The documents state that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that they took photographs of the injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "terrified of reprisals" and was concerned about "being humiliated in public."
The woman, who is 34 years old, is seeking to annul the agreement, as she is still traumatized by the events.
When the alleged assault took place, Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United and this summer he changed to Juventus, a great club in Italian football, for a contract worth 100 million euros.
Brexit: the UK would always regret losing car manufacturers
The UK would "regret it for the rest of our lives" if we lost our global leadership in car manufacturing after Brexit, said Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, Greg Clark.
He added that it was "concerning" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that, if Britain left the EU without a deal, production at its Burnaston factory near Derby would temporarily stop.
We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese manufacturer stated that the impact of delays at customs in the event of a Brexit without an agreement could result in the loss of jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which manufactures Toyota Auris and Avensis models, produced around 150 000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
My view is that, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, there will be production bottlenecks in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, the general manager of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers have expressed their concerns about the impact of leaving the EU without a deal, particularly in relation to cross-border trade; these include Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says that it will close its Mini plant in Oxford one month after Brexit.
The main concerns of car manufacturers relate to the problems that could arise in the assembly lines in the event of a Brexit without an agreement.
The Toyota production line is based on the just-in-time (JIT) method, where parts arrive every 37 minutes from UK and EU suppliers to make cars to order.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there could be a border disruption that, according to the sector, could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
For Toyota, it would be impossible to house the amount of material equivalent to more than one day's inventory in its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and production would be halted.
Mr Clark said that Theresa May's Chequers plan, which sets out future relations with the EU, is 'tuned precisely to avoid such border checks'.
We need an agreement. We want to have the best agreement that will not only allow us to get through this at the moment but that we have to take the opportunity," he said on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme.
"The evidence from Toyota, among many other manufacturers, is that we need to be able to continue with what, so far, has been a tremendously successful supply chain."
Toyota was not able to say for how long production would be halted, but warned that, in the long term, the added costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately the costs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the Unite union representative at the plant, said that his members are increasingly concerned: 'From my experience, once those jobs are lost, they are never recovered.'
A government spokesman said: 'We have put in place a precise and convincing plan for our future relations with the EU.'
Trump-Rosenstein meeting could be postponed again, according to White House
The high-risk meeting between President Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "postponed for another week," as the dispute over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the elections, links between Trump and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the President.
The expectation that Trump would decide to fire the deputy attorney general or not, and thus compromise Mueller &apos; s independence, has fuelled gossip in Washington for months.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had taped his conversations with Trump with a microphone he was wearing himself in an attempt to oust the President through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied this.
However, last Monday he went to the White House, between news reports that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump (who was then in New York at the United Nations) was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he &quot; would prefer not to &quot; fire Rosenstein but the meeting was postponed to avoid a conflict with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to investigate the allegations against Kavanaugh for a week, which would delay the Senate floor vote.
Trump &apos; s press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, he said: "No date has been set, it could be this week or it could be another, considering everything that is happening with the Supreme Court.
We will decide on the spot and I will inform the press, as I usually do."
Some journalists would dispute that assertion: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since 10 September.
Chris Wallace, the host, asked what the reasons were.
Sanders said that the shortage of press was not due to a dislike of TV journalists who acted grandiloquently, although he said: "I would not disagree with the fact that they do grandiloquence."
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
The President holds more Question Time than any other previous Speaker, he said, while citing without evidence: 'We have checked those numbers'.
Press briefings would continue, he said, but "if the press has the option of asking the President of the United States directly, I think that is much better than asking me."
We have tried to do this many times and you have seen us do this many times in the last weeks, so this would replace a press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump usually answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in public events or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences with him alone are very rare.
Indeed, this week, in New York, the President demonstrated why this was so, with an unguarded and sometimes bizarre appearance before the assembled press.
The Scottish NHS Chief Executive writes to EU workers in Scotland about their fears of Brexit
The Scottish Government has written to the EU workforce working in the Scottish HSC to express the gratitude of the country and its wish for them to stay with them post-Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter just six months before the UK leaves the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to covering the cost of citizenship applications for EU citizens working in non-devolved public services.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote: 'During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on exit continued, with the decision to be taken this autumn expected.
However, the United Kingdom Government has also stepped up preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know that all this must be very confusing for you.
And it is for that reason that I would like to reiterate how much I value the contribution of each individual member of staff, regardless of nationality.
EU and other professionals bring valuable experience and many skills that strengthen and enhance the work of the health service, of which patients and the communities we serve benefit.
Scotland is, without doubt, your home and we would love to continue to have you with us."
Christion Abercrombie is being operated on urgently after sustaining a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers player Christion Abercrombie was taken to hospital for emergency surgery after suffering a head injury last Saturday, when the Tigers lost 31-27 to Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ of the Tennesseean.
Tennessee State coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before the break.
He came to the band and collapsed there and then," said Reed.
Both the coaches and the medical staff administered oxygen to Abercrombie on the sideline before placing him on a stretcher and taking him to the medical tent for a more thorough examination.
A staff member at Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left the Vanderbilt Medical Center operation.
Harris added that "there were no details on the type of injury or damage" and that Tennessee State is trying to find out when it happened.
Abercrombie, a redshirt sophomore, is playing in his first season with Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He made five tackles on Saturday before leaving the field, adding a total of 18 tackles for the season.
Foreigners will be liable to a higher rate of stamp duty when they purchase property in the United Kingdom
Foreigners will be subject to a higher stamp duty when they buy a property in the UK and the extra money raised will be used to house the homeless, according to the new plans of the Conservatives
The change will neutralise the success of Corbyn's offensive to attract younger voters
The increase in the land transfer tax will be imposed on those who are not paying tax in the United Kingdom
Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year to be spent on the homeless
The additional money raised from the increase in the stamp duty on foreign buyers of property in the UK will be used to help the homeless, Prime Minister Theresa May announced today.
The measure is seen as an attempt to neutralise the success that Jeremy Corbyn is having with his promises to provide more affordable housing to attract younger voters and to target those with higher incomes.
The increase in the land transfer tax will be levied on individuals and companies who do not pay tax in the United Kingdom and the money will be used to incentivise the Government &apos; s policy to tackle begging on the streets.
The surcharge, which is a supplement to the current transmission tax, including the increase in levels introduced two years ago on second-hand housing and the 'buy-to-let' system, could reach up to 3%.
Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year from this change.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of new-build properties in London are bought by people who do not live in the United Kingdom, which leads to price rises and makes it harder for first-time buyers to get on the housing ladder.
Many of the country &apos; s wealthiest areas (especially the capital) have become &quot; ghost towns &quot; because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in stamp duty to help young people buy their first home.
He accused the big builders of maintaining very high prices on properties by buying land without any intention of using it and urged Mrs May to remove the affordable housing levies to solve the'shameful problem of housing in Britain'.
Mr Corbyn has announced a number of very attractive housing reforms, including rent controls and an end to no-fault evictions.
It also proposes to give local authorities more power to build new homes.
Mrs May said: 'Last year I said that I would dedicate my time as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream of improving the lives of every new generation.
This means solving the housing market, which is so badly damaged.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be right that people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as foreign companies, can buy houses more easily than the British working class.
The dream of having a home has become too difficult for many people to achieve and the humiliation of having to sleep on the streets is still too real."
Jack Ross: "My primary objective is to lead Scotland"
The Sunderland coach says his 'primary objective' is to become a Scotland manager at some point.
The 42-year-old Scot is excited by the prospect of reviving the north-east club, which currently occupies third place in League One (the third tier of English football), three points behind the top club.
He moved to Stadium of Light this summer after leading St. Mirren back into the Scottish Premier League last season.
I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
But I only got a B hat," he told Sportsound on BBC Scotland.
But I grew up seeing Scotland at Hampden with my father when I was a boy and that has always made me want to go back.
This opportunity will only become a reality, however, if I manage to run a club successfully."
Among the predecessors of Ross as Sunderland manager are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paolo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic manager says he felt no fear when he went to names so established in a club so big, after rejecting offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
At the moment, success for me is measured by whether I can get this club back into the Premier League.
because the structure and facilities of this club are certainly on a par with those of the Premier League," he said.
It is not easy to achieve, but I would only consider myself to have achieved my objective here if I can return the club to where it should be."
Ross has only been a coach for three years, having spent time as an assistant at Dumbarton and a period of 15 months in the Hearts technical department.
He then helped Alloa recover from relegation to Division Three and turned St. Mirren from being on the brink of relegation to winning the championship the following season.
In fact, Ross says he feels more comfortable now than ever before during his career as a player with Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
He recalled that he had been faced with a "crossroads" when he took over the Alloa.
I always thought that management was what I was best at, much more than playing.
It may sound strange, because it was good, I could make a living out of it and I enjoyed some epic moments.
But playing can be very hard.
You have to face many things every week.
I still suffer from stress and pressure from that work, but I feel good in the direction.
I have always wanted to train and now I have managed to do it, it is the time of my adult life in which I have felt better, without a doubt."

According to a survey, the perfect time for a pint is 5.30 p.m. on a Saturday
The summer heatwave has boosted profits in British pubs fighting to survive, but concentrated all the pressure on restaurant chains.
Pub and bar groups saw sales rise by 2.7 per cent in July, while restaurant sales fell by 4.8 per cent, according to the figures.
Peter Martin, of CGA Business Consultants, which compiled the figures, commented: 'The heat of the days and the fact that England is still in the World Cup have meant that July has kept the pattern of the previous June, when pubs increased their turnover by 2.8%, while restaurants have even fallen a little further.
The 1.8 per cent fall in restaurant trade in June was even worse in July.
Pubs and bars serving mainly alcoholic drinks had their strongest month, compared to most restaurants, where they reduced their profits.
Pubs that serve mainly meals also suffered from the heat, although not to the same extent as restaurant operators.
It seems that people just want to go out to drink.
In managed bars and pubs, beverage sales rose to 6.6 per cent during the month, while meals fell 3 per cent.
Paul Newman, the hospitality and leisure analyst at RSM, said: 'These results follow the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The time and impact of major social or sporting events remain the most significant factors in terms of sales in the OOH market.
It is not surprising that the restaurant groups are still fighting, although the 4.8% fall in sales compared with last year will be particularly painful in view of the continuing cost pressures.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for the catering industry and time will tell whether the cooler temperatures we have had in August will provide the relief they need.
Total sales in pubs and restaurants, including new entrants, were up 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slow decline in branded openings.
Coffer Peach Tracker, which monitors sales in the UK restaurant, bar and pub sector, collects and analyses data from 47 operating groups with combined turnover of over £9 billion and is the market benchmark.
One in five children have secret social media accounts behind their parents &apos; backs
One in five children (some as young as 11) have secret social media accounts behind their parents &apos; and teachers &apos; backs, a survey has revealed
The survey, conducted among 20,000 secondary school students, revealed an increase in the number of fake Instagram pages
The news has heightened fears that sexually explicit material will be published
20 per cent of pupils have a "main" account that they show their parents
One in five children (some as young as 11) create secret social media accounts that hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed the rapid growth in fake Instagram accounts, a site for sharing photos.
The news has heightened fears that sexually explicit content will be published.
Some 20 per cent of the students said they had a "main" account that they showed their parents, while they had other private accounts.
A mother who accidentally came across her 13-year-old daughter &apos; s secret site saw an adolescent encouraging others to &quot; rape me &quot;.
The research, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters" and Headmistresses" Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 per cent of children aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private accounts.
HMC director Mike Buchanan said: 'It is alarming that so many teenagers feel the need to create spaces on the Internet where their parents and teachers cannot find them.'
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" on the Scottish Athletics Federation board
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the board of the Scottish Athletics Federation as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland &apos; s most decorated athlete on the track and field and its chairman, Ian Beattie, described the change as a great opportunity for those who seek to benefit from his great international experience over the past decade.
Eilidh is recognised and respected throughout the Scottish, United Kingdom and worldwide athletics community, and we are confident that Scottish athletics will benefit enormously from her leadership," said Beattie.
Doyle said: 'I like to be the voice of the athletes and I hope to be able to bring things and help to develop sport in Scotland.'
The American, who won the 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta between the four gold medals he won, and who is now a regular expert on the BBC, suffered a transient ischaemic attack which left him unable to walk.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago, I suffered a brain haemorrhage.
He could not walk.
According to the doctors, only time would tell whether I would recover or to what extent I would recover.
It was exhausting, but I managed to recover fully, I had to learn to walk again and I am now doing agility exercises.
Thank you for your messages and words of encouragement!"
The announcement of the breast pump where mothers are compared to cows divides opinion on the Internet
A breast-pump company has divided public opinion on the Internet with an advertisement comparing breast-feeding mothers to cows being milked.
To mark the launch of what is in theory the world &apos; s first silent breast pump, consumer technology company Elvie released an ad inspired by a video with somewhat ironic music, showing mothers talking about the freedom the new breast pump gives them.
Four real women dance in a hay barn, with cows, with slogans such as "Yes, I do it myself, but I don't have a tail" and "Just in case you haven't noticed, they are not udders, they are my breasts."
The chorus continues: "Cut them, cut them, I am feeding their babies, cut them, cut them, I am milking my women."
However, the announcement, which was posted on the company &apos; s Facebook page, has created a great deal of controversy.
With 77 000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received reactions from all kinds of people who have seen it, with many saying that it brings the 'horrors' of the dairy sector to the fore.
"A very unfortunate decision to have cows to announce this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant before they can give birth to produce milk, with the exception that they take their babies away from them days after they are born," wrote one person.
The Elvie breastpump is discreetly attached to a nursing bra (Elvie/Mother).
Another person commented: "Traumatic for the mother and the baby.
But why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who do stay at home?"
Another comment was: 'What a ridiculous announcement.'
However, others defended the advertisement, including a woman who admitted that the song was &quot; ear-splitting &quot;.
I think it is a great idea.
If she were still breastfeeding, she would certainly have one.
When I used the pump, I felt like a cow.
The announcement is a little vague, but I am not going to dwell on it.
It is a brilliant product," a woman told us.
Another person commented: "It is a funny announcement for mothers who use a breast pump (sometimes at work or in public toilets), which makes them feel like cows.
The dairy sector is neither praised nor condemned in the announcement.
The video ends with the women showing that they have been dancing with the discreet bombs concealed in their brassieres.
The concept of the campaign is based on the perception that many women who pump their milk say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes, and is discreetly attached to the nursing bra, allowing users to move, hold their babies and even go out into the street with the pump in operation.
Ana Balarin, a partner and ECD at Mother, comments: &quot; The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By showing expressive women and milk cows together, we wanted to draw attention to the use of breast pumps and their challenges, while at the same time demonstrating in an entertaining and close way the incredible feeling of freedom that the new breast pump offers.
This is not the first time that the Elvie bomb has made the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two children walked the runway for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant minors discreetly moved to a camp on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has increased significantly, despite the fact that the monthly influx at the border has remained at near-normal levels. This is partly due to the hard rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration, which are complicating the possibility of adopting these children.
Traditionally, most of the godparents, who were also undocumented immigrants at the time, feared that proposing to take in a child would put their own stay in the country at risk.
This risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult family members would be required to submit fingerprints and that the data would be shared with government immigration entities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had sought to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested had no criminal record.
Around 80 per cent of the sponsors or their family members are in the country illegally, and a large number of them are criminal immigrants.
We are still pursuing these individuals,” said Albence.
In their efforts to process juveniles more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a maximum of one month from the time of arrest, as opposed to 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to shelter workers.
Many of them will testify by videoconference, rather than in person, to defend their legal status before an immigration judge.
Those who are not considered eligible for amnesty will be deported as soon as possible.
According to the workers in the reception centres and the reports that have emerged in recent months, the longer they are held in custody, the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety or depression, which could lead to violent outbursts or attempts to escape.
According to the defenders, these concerns are even more acute in larger facilities, such as Tornillo, where it is more likely that, due to its size, signs of distress in these children will be overlooked.
Furthermore, the transfer to the camp without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to their friends could cause them trauma, which many are already suffering from.
Syria calls on the "occupation forces" of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that the country &apos; s war is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also the Deputy Prime Minister, said that the foreign forces were illegally on Syrian territory under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that the matter would be dealt with accordingly.
He said that they must be withdrawn immediately and unconditionally.
Moualem insisted that the &quot; war on terrorism &quot; in Syria was &quot; virtually over &quot;, where more than 360,000 people had died since 2011 and several million had been uprooted from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue to &quot; fight this sacred battle until we cleanse all Syrian territories of terrorist groups and any foreign illegal presence &quot;.
The United States has approximately 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly providing training and advice to Syrian Arab and Kurdish forces opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 ground troops in this war-torn country.
On the subject of refugees, Moualem stated that the conditions were in place for their return and blamed &quot; some Western countries &quot; for &quot; sowing irrational fears &quot; that made refugees decide to stay outside the country.
We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns, he said.
They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.
The United States and the European Union have already warned that they will not help with the reconstruction of Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats assert that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel bastion of Idlib has created an opportunity to force political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey averted a large-scale assault by Syrian and Russian forces on the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem has made clear that the agreement had &quot; clear deadlines &quot; and expressed the hope that military action would focus on the jihadists, including fighters of the Nusra Front (linked to Al-Qaeda), who would be &quot; eradicated &quot;.
Staffan de Mistura, the UN special envoy, is expected to convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set the conditions for Syrian government participation in the committee, arguing that the panel &apos; s work should be restricted to &quot; reviewing the articles of the current constitution &quot; and warned against any interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to this logic, Trump would win re-election in 2020, unless, as many liberal viewers will doubtless expect, he is impeached or disgraced prematurely.
This would be without doubt 'the most dramatic end to a presidency ever seen!'
There are no signs of fatigue among the audience at the moment.
Since 2014, the ratings for the prime-time audience have doubled to 1.05 million for CNN and have nearly tripled to 1.6 million for MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in the prime time audience, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and “The Rachel Maddow Show” on MSNBC has surpassed cable channels in nightly news ratings with 3.5 million viewers for its main nightly news programs.
“It is an odd attraction that we have not yet understood,” Neal Baer, the show’s executive producer, tells us, “Designated Survivor,” a dramatic series on ABC about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after a terrorist attack destroys the Capitol.
Veteran comedy writer and author of &quot; Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking into the Hollywood Boys &apos; Club &quot;, Nell Scovell has another theory.
He recalls a taxi ride he took in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The taxi driver told him that he would vote for Trump.
Why?
Scovell was told, "Because it makes me laugh."
Chaos is always on the rise in the world of entertainment.
Obviously, and unlike everything else that is seen on television, the arguments that come out of Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, the possibility of immigrant families being able to reunite or the health of the global economy.
Disconnection is a luxury that only the most privileged can afford.
But the information overload is compounded by the fact that you have been watching a panel of experts debating the use of &quot; deep background &quot; sources that Bob Woodward used for his book &quot; Fear &quot;, the $15,000 ostrich-leather jacket of Paul Manafort (&quot; an ostentatious extravagance, in the words of The Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy Daniels &apos; s lurid descriptions of Trump &apos; s anatomy.
As far as I am concerned, I will never look at Super Mario in the same way again.
“By offering something new every night, it is in part what makes everything seem like a reality show,” says Brent Montgomery, executive producer of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of “Pawn Stars,” when we talk about the alternating Trump show and its daily twists and turns (whether it is fighting the NFL or praising Kim Jong-un).
You cannot afford to miss an episode if you do not want to fall behind.
When I went to talk to Mr. Fleiss this week, it was a sunny 27 degrees on the north coast of Kauai, but he was inside watching MSNBC and recording CNN.
He could not tear himself away from the television, not with Brett Kavanaugh ready to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging in the balance.
I remember when we were doing all those crazy programmes and people were saying that this was the beginning of the end of Western civilisation.
I thought it was a joke, but in the end they were right.

Foreign money flows into the more tightly controlled midterm elections of the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that money is flowing into Pennsylvania &apos; s 17th District, thanks to the restructuring of a congressional district with two candidates seeking re-election to the same seat.
This residential district of Pittsburgh, whose structure was recently redrawn, is represented by Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb faces another Republican challenger, Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th District of Pennsylvania, a district that overlaps heavily with the new 17th.
The maps were redrawn after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the old districts had been unconstitutionally gerrymandered in favour of Republicans.
The race for the new 17 has triggered a funding contest between the main financial arms of the parties, the Democratic National Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
The name Lamb became very familiar in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a special election in March for the 18th Congressional District.
That seat had been held by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
The political experts have given the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States considered penalizing El Salvador for its support of China, although it later reversed its decision
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with a slight rejection by Washington.
Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and occupied a hotel in Panama until the partners evicted the Trump Organization &apos; s management team.
State Department officials decided to recall the heads of the United States diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of &quot; recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan &quot;, said State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert in a statement this month.
But only El Salvador was sanctioned, which had already received around $140 million in US aid in 2017 for, among other things, the control of drug trafficking, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts in financial aid and restrictions on certain visas, would have been very painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and crime rates.
As the internal meetings progressed, the United States and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar meeting held last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent emigration to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior officials in the Administration made it clear that their intention was for the conference to proceed, putting an end to any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is expected to speak at the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October and which, diplomats say, is a sign of the importance the administration has placed on the meeting.
The three American envoys returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without further threats or punishment from Washington.
A White House spokesman declined to comment on the details of the discussion described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal deliberations on condition of anonymity.
His explanations were corroborated by an external analyst close to the administration, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
The study of history
The next step could be the report of the special counsel Robert Mueller on possible obstruction of justice by Trump, of which there is already considerable evidence in the public record.
Mueller is also thought to be investigating the possibility that the Trump campaign worked in tandem with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If the Congress changes hands, Trump will be held accountable to that body, just as he is preparing to run for re-election and perhaps ultimately to a jury of his peers.
This is a lot of ifs and buts, and I am not suggesting that the fall of Trump is inevitable, or that of his counterparts in Europe.
We will all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will have an effect on the duration of the conflict.
In 1938, the German officers were ready to stage a coup against Hitler. All that was needed was for the West to have resisted and supported the Czechs at Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
History revolves around these turning points, and the inexorable march of democracy accelerates or slows down.
The Americans are now facing several such turning points.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of the Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein has been in the good since this paper reported last year that he had suggested secretly recording the President and speculating about his inability to do the job.
Rosenstein says that The Times &apos; explanation is not accurate.
How will we respond if the new FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
On top of all this, will we vote in midterm elections for a Congress that will be accountable to Trump?
If we fail these tests, we will be facing a long winter for democracy.
But thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague, I believe we will not fail.
My mother was a Czech Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador's house.
He survived, emigrated to the United States and, 60 years later, sent me to light the Sabbath candles on the same table adorned with a swastika.
With that inheritance, how can I not be optimistic about our future?

Graham Dorrans of Rangers, optimistic ahead of the match against Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will play at home on Thursday against Rapid Vienna, knowing that a win over the Austrians, after the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal at the beginning of the month, will put them in a strong position to qualify for the Europa League group stage.
A knee injury prevented Rangers midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season until the 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can use that result as a springboard for bigger things.
“We got a good result, because Villarreal is a good team,” he said.
We started the match believing we could get something and we ended up with a point.
Perhaps we could have won in the end, but, overall, the draw was perhaps a fair result.
They were better in the first half, but after the break we came out fighting and we were the better team.
This Thursday we will have another great European night.
I hope we can get all three points, but it will be a difficult game because they did well in the previous match. But with the whole crowd behind us, I am sure we can get a positive result.
Last year was definitely tough with my injuries and the changes in the club, but now there is a general feeling that everything will be all right.
The team is well, the boys are enjoying themselves enormously and we are having a good training session.
I hope that we can move forward, leave last season behind and achieve success.
Fear of retirement savings is keeping some women awake at night
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be treated, few people spoke about this with their families.
About half of the people who took part in the Nationwide study said they did talk to their partners about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 per cent said they talked to their children about this.
People want to be cared for by a family member, but they are not taking the steps to have that conversation, says Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance company Nationwide.
This is the way to begin.
Talk to your spouse and your children: you cannot prepare your family to care for you if you do not express your wishes in advance.
Work with your adviser and your family to discuss where and how to receive care, as these options may be a determining factor in the cost.
Incorporate into the conversion to his financial adviser, as he may also be able to help him find a way to pay for these costs.
Their long-term care financing options may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value to help them cover costs or insure themselves with their own savings, as long as they have the money.
Negotiate your legal documents: get ahead of the legal curve.
Ensure that a medical power of attorney is obtained to appoint a trusted person to oversee his/her medical care and to ensure that professionals comply with his/her wishes in the event that he/she is unable to communicate.
It may also prepare a notarial power of attorney for its finances.
Select a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that your bills are paid if you become incapacitated.
Don &apos; t forget the small details: imagine your elderly father is having a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would he be able to answer questions on medicines and allergies?
Please describe all these details in a written plan so that it is always at hand.
"It is not just the finances that are at stake: which doctors do we have to treat?" asks Martin.
What medicines are you taking?
Who will look after the dog?
Everything has to be planned.
Man shot several times with a rifle in Ilfracombe
They shot a man with a rifle several times as he was walking home after leaving the house at night.
The victim, a man in his 40s, was in the area of Oxford Grove in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
The police officers described the shooting, which occurred around 02:30 (BST), as a &quot; random act &quot;.
The victim did not see his assailant.
His injuries were not life-threatening and the police had appealed for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu last Friday, authorities said, with the number of deaths expected to rise.
With communications blocked, aid workers have been unable to obtain any information from the regency of Donggala, an area north of Palu that is closest to the epicentre of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important details about Palu and Donggala on Sulawesi island:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a regency that stretches over more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the north-west of Sulawesi Island.
The governorate, which is a lower-level administrative region, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of Central Sulawesi Province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but are concentrated mainly in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck the west of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire, an area of high seismic activity, and is often struck by earthquakes.
We now summarize some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake in the western coast of Aceh Province, North Sumatra, on 26 December triggered a tsunami that affected 14 countries and claimed the lives of 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast. More than half of the victims were in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes struck the western coast of Sumatra at the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds of deaths were reported on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck the southern part of Java, the most populous island in Indonesia, and triggered a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing almost 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra Province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands near Sumatra, triggering a tsunami up to 10 metres high that destroyed dozens of villages and killed some 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya Regency in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, recalling the devastation of the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
This time, it did not cause a tsunami, but the collapse of buildings killed more than 100 people.
2018: The tourist island of Lombok, Indonesia, was hit by a series of large earthquakes, killing more than 500 people, most on the island &apos; s northern side.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily displaced.
Sarah Palin &apos; s eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, a citizen of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a domestic violence report and resisting arrest, according to a report issued by the Alaska State Police on Saturday.
According to the police report, when a known acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took the phone away from her.
Palin was placed in pretrial detention at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is being held on a $500 unsecured bond, KTUU reported.
He was brought before the court on Saturday, where he was declared &quot; definitely innocent &quot; when asked to give his statement, the chain reported.
Palin is facing three Class A misdemeanors, which means up to a year in prison and a $25,000 fine.
He has also been charged with a minor Class B offence, with a maximum sentence of one day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Her mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, interfering with the reporting of a domestic violence crime and possessing a firearm while under the influence of alcohol, in relation to the incident.
His girlfriend had claimed that he had punched him in the face.
Several veterans &apos; groups criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 for linking her son &apos; s violent behaviour to post-traumatic stress disorder from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after a 7.7 magnitude earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi last Friday.
The earthquake of magnitude 7.5 triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of houses.
Electricity and communications networks have been down and the number of deaths is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake struck just outside the Sulawesi centre, which is located in the north-east of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
There are several videos circulating on social media showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami struck the coast.
Federal prosecutors seek death penalty for suspect in New York terrorist attack
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terror attack that killed eight people, an extraordinary punishment that has not been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, allegedly used a rented Home Depot truck to carry out a bike lane attack in October last year on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, mowing down pedestrians and cyclists in his path.
To justify a death sentence, prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed &quot; intentionally &quot; the eight victims and caused &quot; intentionally &quot; serious bodily injury, in accordance with the notice of intent to seek the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
The two charges carry a possible death sentence, according to the court document.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of murder in aid of racketeering, which is a charge often used by federal prosecutors in such cases, and one count of motor vehicle violence and destruction.
The attack required &quot; substantial planning and premeditation &quot;, according to the prosecutors, who described how Saipov carried it out as &quot; atrocious, cruel and depraved &quot;.
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco, as specified in the notice of claim.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been a decade since the last time the Southern District of New York prosecuted a capital case.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of killing two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was carried out in a New York federal case was in 1953, when Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed by electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, an immigrant from Uzbekistan, showed no remorse during the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack by watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also reportedly asked for the ISIS flag to be flown in his hospital room, according to the police.
He was acquitted of 22 counts.
Saipov &apos; s federal public defender, David Patton, said that they are &quot; obviously disappointed &quot; with the decision of the prosecution.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept a plea of guilty to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole will only prolong the trauma of these events for all involved,” said Patton.
Saipov &apos; s defence team had previously requested the prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel Farage should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to'mobilise the people's army' today during a protest at Tory conference.
The former UKIP leader said that politicians had to 'feel the heat' of Eurosceptics, while one of Theresa May's MPs suggested that he should be in charge of the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said at the Birmingham rally that the UK would have 'got out' if Nigel Farage had been Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge facing Prime Minister May in trying to reconcile her divided ranks has been highlighted even further when a group of Tories in favour of remaining have joined a protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is fighting to keep the Chequers compromise on track in the face of attacks from Brexit supporters, her opponents and the EU.
The allies insisted that they will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the violent reaction, and will force Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between their package and 'chaos'.
Leave Means Leave's rally in Solihull was addressed by Mr Bone, who said that he wanted to reject the Chequers plan.
He suggested that Farage should have been given a post with responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he had been in charge, we would have been out by now,” he said.
This Member of Parliament for Wellingborough added: 'I am going to defend Brexit, but we have to ditch Chequers.'
In his opposition to the EU he said: 'We have not fought in world wars to be servile.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: 'The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay in the European Union is completely false.'
Brexit Tory Andrea Jenkyns was also at the rally, where she told reporters: 'I just say one thing: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The public at large do not like the Chequers plan, the opposition is not going to vote for it and it is not popular with our party and our activists, who are the ones who actually go out on the streets and vote for us first.
Forget Chequers and start listening.
In a message to May, he added: &quot; Prime ministers hold their offices when they keep their promises &quot;.
Farage told the crowd that the politicians would have to be made to feel the heat if they were to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
“It is now a question of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” he said.
They are trying to betray Brexit and today we are here to tell them that they will not get away with it.
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: 'I want to make our political class, which is about to betray Brexit, feel the heat.
We will mobilise the people's army of this country that gave us victory with Brexit and we will never rest until we have become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, the pro-remain campaigners marched through the streets of Birmingham before the two-hour rally in the city centre.
Some activists waved placards reading 'Tories Against Brexit' after the group's launch this weekend.
Labour peer Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives for the security problems they had with an application of the party during the opening of the conference.
These are the same people who tell us that they can implement the computer systems and all the technology for Canada Plus Plus, for the harmonized borders, for the free trade without borders in Ireland, he added.
It is a total farce.
There is nothing that can be called a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren considers all possibilities for running for the presidency
US Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "seriously consider" running for president after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future during a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will be running for re-election in November against Geoff Diehl, the Republican state representative, who was co-chair of Trump &apos; s Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
There has been considerable speculation about the possibility of Warren facing Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was her thirty-sixth town hall meeting with voters using the municipal format since Trump took office.
An assistant asked him if he was planning to run for the presidency.
Warren responded that it is time for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that includes having a woman at the top.
A suspect in the shooting death of LSU football player Sims arrested
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced Saturday that a suspect has been arrested in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims last Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at a press conference at 11 a.m.
They had released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help in identifying a man seen in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot dead near the campus of Southern University at the start of Friday.
Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head that ultimately led to his death, said Police Chief Murphy J. Paul to the media on Saturday, for 247sports.
Wayde went to defend a friend and was shot by Simpson.
During the interrogation, Simpson admitted to being at the crime scene, in possession of a weapon and to having shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and booked into the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 1.98m player from Baton Rouge, played in 32 games last season, starting 10, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton closes in on world title after team orders handed him victory over Sebastian Vettel
Since Valtteri Bottas had qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it had become clear that the team orders of Mercedes would play a major role in the race.
From pole position Bottas had a good start and almost put Hamilton out of the picture by defending his position in the first two laps and inviting Vettel to attack his team-mate.
Vettel was first into the pits and let Hamilton run in his slipstream, which should have been decisive.
Mercedes came out strongly on the next lap and was behind Vettel, but Hamilton overtook after a wheel-to-wheel move that made the Ferrari driver give up the inside line at the expense of a double move to defend himself on the third corner.
Max Verstappen, who was 21 years old on that day, started from the last row of the grid and finished seventh in the first race.
He then led most of the race while clinging to his tyres to get a quick finish and beat Kimi Räikkönen for fourth place.
Finally, he entered the pits on lap 44, but was unable to increase his pace in the remaining eight laps to regain fourth place.
It was a tough day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and was a real gentleman in letting me through.
The team has done an exceptional job in getting a perfect match,” said Hamilton.
That was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for her insistence that she did not leak Christine Blasey Ford &apos; s letter accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in Virginia, the President did not directly mention the testimony offered by Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that there were people who were &quot; bad, repugnant and false &quot;.
“The only thing that could happen and the good thing that is happening these last few days in the Senate is when you see the anger, when you see people who are bad, repugnant and false,” he said.
When you read the publications and the leaks, and then they say 'But I did not do it.'
I did not do that.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak it?
Remember your answer... did you filter the document? - 'Oh, oh, what?
Oh no.
I did not leak it.
Well, wait a minute.
Have we filtered? No, we have not filtered,” he added while imitating the Senator.
Feinstein received the letter detailing Ford &apos; s allegations against Kavanaugh in July and it was leaked in early September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.
“I did not hide Dr. Ford &apos; s allegations, I did not leak her story,” Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
She asked me to keep it confidential and I did so.
But his refusal did not seem to sit well with the President, who during the Saturday night rally commented as follows: "I will tell you something: that was really bad body language."
Perhaps he did not, but that is the worst body language I have ever seen.
Continuing his defence of the nominee to the Supreme Court, who has been accused of inappropriate sexual conduct by three women, the President suggested that the Democrats were using the allegations for their own ends.
They are determined to regain power by any means possible.
You see the evil and the repugnance, they don &apos; t care who they hurt, who they have to step on to get the power and the control,” said the president, as reported by Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored twice for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars made up for their defeat in the Elite League on Friday night against Belfast Giants by winning the return match on Saturday night by 5-3 in Dundee.
The Giants took an early lead of two goals through the strikes of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied the local score before Dwyer restored the Giants lead.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's two goals secured the victory.
This was the third defeat of the season for the men of Adam Keefe, who had beaten Dundee 2-1 in Belfast the previous night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
The first goal by Dwyer came in the fourth minute (3:35) with an assist from Kendall McFaull, while David Rutherford provided the assist for Beauvillier to double the lead four minutes later.
In what could be considered an exciting opening period, Sullivan put the local team back in the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt tied the game at 15:16 with Cownie.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took the lead before the first break when he scored his second goal of the night at the end of the first half.
The local team regrouped and Bouchard once again equalized with a goal in the 27:37 minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the match in the second half and the victory was secured with the fifth goal of the team in the closing stages.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, play at home to Milton Keynes in their next match on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies so hundreds can escape on earthquake plane
An Indonesian air traffic controller is being hailed as a hero after dying in the process of ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of people safely took off.
More than 800 people were killed and many are missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to rattle the area, and many are trapped in the rubble in the city of Palu.
Despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives, Anthonius Gunawan Agung, 21, refused to leave his post at the control tower of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu, which was being buffeted by strong winds.
It held its ground to ensure that Batik Air flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could safely take off.
He jumped from the traffic control tower when he thought it was collapsing.
He later died in hospital.
The spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, as reported by the Australian ABC News.
We had prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
“Our hearts break when we hear this,” he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the death toll could reach several thousand people, while the national disaster mitigation agency reports that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
The number of victims is expected to continue to rise, as many bodies were still under the rubble and many people could not be contacted, he told us.
A wave that reached six metres high has devastated Palu, which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Aid and supplies are being brought in by military and commercial aircraft.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: &quot; Every minute an ambulance comes with more bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
Mini-markets are being looted everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: &quot; The Indonesian Red Cross is trying to help as much as possible the survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could have been much worse.
The President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country &apos; s army: &quot; I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?”, CNN reported.
Indonesia had already been hit by earthquakes in Lombok in early this year, killing more than 550 people.
Air Niugini now says that a man has disappeared after the air accident in a lagoon in Micronesia
The airline, which operates a flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now says that a man has disappeared, after saying that the 47 passengers and crew had evacuated the sinking aircraft safely.
Air Niugini stated in a press release that since Saturday evening, no male passenger had been accounted for.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for further details on the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats were used to assist in rescuing the other passengers and crew after the aircraft crashed into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk airport.
The authorities said on Friday that seven people had been transferred to hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday and were all in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events are still not clear.
The airline and the United States Navy said that the aircraft landed in the lagoon before the runway.
Some witnesses thought that the aircraft had overrun the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said that the plane came in very low.
That is extremely good, Jaynes said.
Jaynes comments that he and other passengers were able to swim through water up to their waists to the emergency exits of the aircraft that was beginning to sink.
He said that the flight attendants panicked and screamed, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The United States Navy said that sailors working on a pier improvement also helped in the rescue by using an inflatable boat to ferry people to shore before the aircraft sank about 30 metres (100 feet) below the water.
The data from the aviation safety network indicate that 111 people have died in registered airline accidents in Papua New Guinea over the last two decades, but none with Air Niugini.
An analyst presents the chronology of the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecution completed its arguments in the retrial of a man accused of burning a woman to death in Mississippi in 2014 on Saturday.
The United States Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used mobile phone records to track the movements of 29-year-old Quinton Tellis, the defendant, and 19-year-old Jessica Chambers, the victim, the night she died.
Rowlett said he received location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night of his death, contradicting his previous statements, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his mobile phone had been with Chambers &apos; phone during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to speak with Sanford.
Sanford took the stand on Saturday and testified that he had not been in the city on that day.
When the prosecutors asked Tellis if he was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford &apos; s truck that night, Sanford said he was &quot; lying because my truck was in Nashville &quot;.
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said that he had met Chambers approximately two weeks before his death.
The mobile phone records indicated that they had only met one week before.
Rowlett said that at some point after Chambers &apos; death, Tellis deleted Chambers &apos; messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
Hale said, &quot; She was erased from his life.
The defence is scheduled to begin its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he hoped that the trial would be completed by the jury that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to fill their music with positive messages to challenge the negative image of gender.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hip-hop has moved away from its roots of political messages and social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Acts such as The Fugees and Common have seen a recent resurgence in the UK thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Or another black person?
A New York nanny sues a couple for firing her after a "racist" text message
A New York nanny is suing a couple for discriminatory termination after receiving a text message from the mother complaining that she was “another black person.”
The couple deny that they are racist and compare the demand to a case of &quot; extortion &quot;.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, was shocked to discover that the new childminder, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived for her first day of work in 2016.
“NOOOOOOO ANOTHER BLACK PERSON,” Ms. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mauritius twice.
After realizing his mistake, a "discomfited" Plasco-Flaxman fired Maurice, claiming that his former nanny, who was African-American, had done a poor job and that he was waiting for a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Mauritius received the pay for one day of work and sent it home by Uber.
Mauritius is now suing the couple for compensation for the termination of employment with the intention of receiving compensation of $350 per day for the position of six months &apos; work for which she had been hired, but without a contract.
He told The Post on Friday that he wanted to show them that things were not done that way, adding that &quot; I know it is a case of discrimination &quot;.
The couple responded to the allegations of racism by saying that the termination of Maurice &apos; s employment was the most reasonable course of action, as they feared that they would not be able to trust him after having offended him.
My wife had sent him something he did not want to say.
She is not racist.
We are not racists," said Joel Plasco to Post.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you have been rude to, even if it was by mistake?"
Your newborn baby?
Come on!
Comparing the demand to 'extortion,' Plasco said that his wife had given birth to the baby two months earlier and was in a'very difficult situation.'
"Are you going to go after someone like that?
That is not very decent,” the investment banker added.
Although the legal case is still pending, the public opinion court has quickly denounced the couple on social networks, criticizing their behaviour and logic.
Paddington editors feared readers would not identify with a talking bear, reveals new letter
Bond &apos; s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: &quot; It was difficult to put oneself in the place of someone reading it for the first time before publication.
It is very amusing to know now what we know about the great success of Paddington.”
After saying that her father, who had worked as a BBC dresser before being inspired by a teddy bear to write the children &apos; s book, was hoping that his work would be rejected, she added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was &quot; bittersweet &quot; after his death last year.
Of Paddington, whom she described as &quot; a very important member of our family &quot;, she added that her father was very proud of her final success.
He was a very quiet man and did not like to boast, he said.
But as Paddington had been so real to him, it was almost as if you had a child who had achieved something important: you were proud of him, though he was not really your achievement.
I think he saw the success of Paddington in that way.
Although he was its creator and product of his imagination, he always gave credit to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye by telephone
On landing, his daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where the doctors worked in vain to save her life.
“I was calling regularly to say that the situation was really bad, that they did not expect me to succeed,” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
I then received a call from Nad telling me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said to him, &quot; Tashi, I love you very much, darling.
I will be there for you.
I will be with you.
The drugs the doctors had given him to keep his heart pumping were slowly wearing off and leaving his system.
She had died too soon and everything was going out.
I could only sit there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I could not scream, shout or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to stand my ground.
Finally, Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, now suffering from the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, unaware of the terrible experience that was unfolding.
He said, &quot; Nobody knew &quot;.
I bent my head and tears were constantly falling.
It is difficult to explain, but it was on the flight that I felt this overwhelming sense of sympathy for Nad.
That he needed all my love and understanding.
He knew how much he loved me.
Women in Mourning cards to prevent suicides is a bridge
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide are working to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been putting cards on a bridge in Wales with inspirational messages and phone numbers people can call for help.
Tyler, the son of Mrs. Davis, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
He said, &quot; I do not want any father to feel what I feel every day.
Davis, 45, of Lydney, said his son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
He was known to everyone by his smile.
They always said that their smile lit up any place.
However, he left his work before he died, as he was &quot; in a really dark place &quot;.
In 2014, Tyler &apos; s brother, who was 11 at the time, found him after he had taken his own life.
Ms. Davis said: 'I am constantly concerned that it could have an impact.'
Davis created the cards &quot; so people know there are people to go to and people to talk to, even if it is a friend.
You must speak out, you must talk about it.
Ms. Humphreys, who is a friend of Davies &apos; s for years, lost Mark, her partner of 15 years, shortly after her mother &apos; s death.
He did not say that he was depressed or anything like that, he tells us.
"A couple of days before Christmas we noticed a change in his attitude.
The day of Christmas came to its lowest point: when the children opened their gifts, he did not even look at them.
He said that their loss was a great trauma for them, but they must overcome it: &quot; It leaves a void in the whole family.
It has left us devastated.
But we all have to keep fighting.

The future of Brett Kavanaugh hangs in the balance as the FBI begins its investigation
Mr. Flake said on Saturday that he thought that if we could actually get something like what he was asking for (a limited-time, limited-scope investigation), perhaps we could bring a little unity to it, and he feared that the committee was &quot; going down the tubes &quot; in the midst of a partisan stalemate.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI investigation to take place?
It is a question of timing.
There are only five weeks to go to the mid-term elections on 6 November, and if, as expected, the Republicans do badly, their efforts to elect the man they want for the highest court in the land will be seriously weakened.
George W. Bush has been calling senators, pressuring them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for him in the White House. Thanks to Bush, Kavanaugh met his wife Ashley, who was the President's personal secretary.
What happens once the FBI publishes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice-President Mike Pence to break the tie and confirm him for the Supreme Court.
North Korean defector numbers &quot; fall &quot; with Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Ministry of Unification of the South, said that there were 1,127 desertions last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said that tighter border controls between North Korea and China, and the high fees charged by traffickers, had been key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments on this matter.
The vast majority of defectors from the North are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers deserters to be illegal immigrants rather than refugees and, in many cases, they are repatriated.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have improved markedly in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that focused on the denuclearization negotiations.
This came after the historic June meeting between United States President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Singapore, which agreed in general terms to work towards a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the United States sanctions for the lack of progress.
Without U.S. confidence, there will be no confidence in our national security and, under these circumstances, we will not be the first to unilaterally disarm, Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is not fit to serve on the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the minority in the House of Representatives, said that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was a &quot; hysteric &quot; and was not fit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I cannot help but think if a woman had acted in that way, they would have called her hysterical,” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh &apos; s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh used emotion to deny the allegations that he sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, at times almost shouting and choking up while talking about his family and his years of secondary education.
In the committee, he also explicitly condemned Democrats, calling the allegations against him &quot; grotesque and clearly coordinated smears &quot; organized by disgruntled liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that, in her view, Kavanaugh &apos; s testimony proved that he could not serve on the Supreme Court because it showed his bias against Democrats.
“I think he is disqualifying himself with those statements and the way he has pursued the Clintons and the Democrats,” he said.
Pelosi objected when asked if she would challenge Kavanaugh if confirmed and if the Democrats won a majority in the House.
“I will say one thing: if she is not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, she is not fit to be on the Supreme Court, and she is not fit to be on the court she is on now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about possible rulings by Kavanaugh against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case, as he is considered a conservative judge.
At his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
This is not the time for an hysterical and impartial person to go to court and expect us to think that everything is fine," said Pelosi.
And women must take it up.
It is a justified diatribe, months and years of fury overflowing, and she cannot let it go without crying.
We cry when we are angry, said Ms. Steinem 45 years later.
“I do not think that is so unusual, do you?”
He continued: &quot; I was helped a lot by a woman who was an executive in a company and who told me that she also cried when she was angry, but that she had developed a technique whereby when she was angry and began to cry, she would say to the person with whom she was speaking: &quot; Perhaps you think I am sad because I am crying.
No, I am not angry.”
And then he went on with what he was doing.
I thought it was great.”
Tears are allowed as a way out of anger partly because they are not really understood.
One of the clearest memories I have of one of my first jobs, in a male-dominated office, was once finding myself in tears with an unexpressed rage. A senior woman manager, whom I had always had a slight fear of, grabbed me by the hair and dragged me up a staircase.
He said to me, &quot; Never let them see you cry &quot;.
You have no idea how angry I am.
They think you are sad and will be glad because they think they have cornered you.
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Hart was caught in an extramarital affair on board a ship called Monkey Business, which forced him to withdraw from the presidential race, a deeply frustrated Schroeder thought that there was no reason why she should not run for the presidency herself.
It was not a well-considered decision, he said to me 30 years later, with a laugh.
There were already seven candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone referred to us as Snow White and the Seven Dwarves.”
As the campaign was already well advanced, he fell behind in fund-raising, and was promised that he would not run again unless he raised two million dollars.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to the men gave her only $250.
“Do you think I have a discount?”, he asked.
When she gave her speech announcing that she would not have a formal campaign, she was so overcome by emotion (gratitude for the people who had supported her, frustration with a system that made it difficult to raise funds and that focused on getting voters rather than delegates, and anger at sexism), that she choked.
"It would have been logical to think that he had had a nervous breakdown," said Schroeder, recalling the reaction of the press.
You might have thought that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they going to put on my tombstone?
Did he cry?”
The trade war between the United States and China could benefit Beijing
The first salvos of the trade war between the United States and China were deafening, and although there is still a long way to go before the battle is over, a rupture between the countries could benefit Beijing, experts say.
Donald Trump, the US President, issued the first warning in early 2018 by placing tariffs on major Chinese exports, such as solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation took place this week with new tariffs on $200 billion (£150 billion) of goods, which will tax half of the goods that come into the United States from China.
On each occasion, Beijing has retaliated in kind, recently imposing tariffs of 5 to 10 per cent on American products worth $60 billion.
China has committed itself to matching the United States' attacks, and it is unlikely that the world's second largest economy will soon ease up.
To back down from Washington would mean giving in to demands, but publicly submitting to the United States would be too shameful for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Even so, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards right, the United States &apos; trade war could help China in the long run by reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing could set the stage for a crash landing in the economy in either country is, in fact, far more dangerous than has been recognized by observers so far, said Abigail Grace, associate fellow focused on Asia for the Center for New American Security.
Syria ready to receive refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria asserts that it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and requests assistance in rebuilding a country devastated by a war that has lasted more than seven years.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the conditions in the country were improving.
The situation on the ground is today more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism.
The Government was continuing to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists in an effort to restore normalcy.
All the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees who had been forced to leave their country because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that had affected their daily lives and livelihoods were in place.
The UN estimates that since the war began in 2011, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country.
There are another six million people in the country who still need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem acknowledged that the Syrian regime would welcome assistance in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he also emphasized that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that had promoted the insurgency.
Europe wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National, outside Paris, France.
The United States now has six consecutive defeats on European soil since its last Ryder Cup victory in Europe in 1993.
Europe regained the crown when the Danish team of Thomas Bjorn managed to get the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
American golfer Phil Mickelson, who had to fight for most of the tournament, threw his ball into the water on the 16th hole, thus admitting defeat to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Francesco Molinari excelled in all his rounds, becoming one of only four players to ever post a 5-0-0 score since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth lost to the lowest-ranked player on the European team, Dane Thorbjorn Olesen, 5 and 4.
The world number one, Dustin Johnson, went down 2 and 1 to Englishman Ian Poulter, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
Sergio García, a veteran with eight Ryder Cups under his belt, became the European with the most wins in the tournament of all time, with 25.5 points in his career.
I do not usually cry, but today I cannot help it.
It has been a very hard year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I am very, very happy to have been able to win the cup.
It was a team effort and I am very happy to have been able to help,” said an emotional García after the European team's victory.
Now it is the turn of his compatriot John Rahm, who defeated the American golf legend Tiger Woods by 2 and 1 in a match play game on Sunday.
I feel an incredible pride in having beaten Tiger Woods, because I grew up watching this man,” said 23-year-old golfer John Rahm.
Woods lost the four matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in his Ryder Cup career.
This is a strange statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 major titles, trailing only Jack Nicklaus.
The American team had to fight all weekend to find the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played great golf all week.
Captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team &apos; s disappointing performance: &quot; I am very proud of these guys, they never stopped fighting.
There was a moment this morning when we heated up the situation in Europe.
But we spoil it.
I would like to congratulate Mr Thomas.
He is a great captain.
Your 12 players have played a very good game.
We will regroup, I will meet with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we will move forward.
I love these 12 boys and I am proud to be their captain.
It is now our turn to bow our heads.
They have surpassed us.”
