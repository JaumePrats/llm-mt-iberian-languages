In addition to confirming that at least some dinosaurs were feathered, a widely accepted theory, also offers specific data that fossils generally do not offer, such as their color and three-dimensional structure.
According to the experts, this animal has a brownish color on the upper part and a pale or carotene color on the lower part.
In addition, the discovery allows us to better understand the evolution of the feathers of birds.
Given that the dinosaur's plumage does not have a well-developed axis, called raquis, but does have other plumage features (feathers and quills), the researchers came to the conclusion that the raquis is probably the result of a later evolutionary development of these other features.
The structure that presents the plumage suggests that its function was not related to flight, but to regulate body temperature or as an indicator of the same. The researchers argue that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample analyzed presents features of the plumage of an adult and not of a chick.
The experts' comments were that, even though it is the tail of a short-lived dinosaur, the sample illustrates more the plumage of an adult than that of a chick.

While there are reports that the official number of deaths is eight and the authorities have confirmed that about 30 people were injured, the official numbers are still unknown.
Concentrations of acid cyanide and melamine were found in the urine samples of animals that died after eating food for pets contaminated.
The researchers indicated that the two compounds react with each other to give rise to crystals that can obstruct renal function.
Specialists detected the formation of crystals in the urine of cats, due to the incorporation of melamine and cyanuric acid.
When compared through the use of infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), it could be determined that the composition of the crystals coincides with the one found in the urine of the affected animals.
I don't know if you've noticed this or not, but most of the products coming from Central America were free of taxes.
Even so, the countries of Central America imposed tariffs of 80 percent on the products that we manufacture. We treat you.
It didn't make sense to me; it definitely wasn't fair.
The only thing I tell people is that you treat us the way we treat you.
A proposed law was dictated by the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, which prohibits the sale or rental of violent video games to minors.
The bill proposes that violent video games sold in the state of California must be labeled with a sticker with the legend "18" and penalizes their sale to minors with a fine of $1000 for non-compliance.
The Director of the Crown Prosecution Service, Kier Starmer QC, made a statement this morning informing that Huhne and Pryce would be brought to trial.
Huhne has resigned, and Ed Davey MP will replace him in the cabinet. It is expected that Norman Lamb MP will take over the post of business minister that Davey leaves vacant.
The 16th of February is the date on which Huhne and Pryce are scheduled to appear before the Westminster Magistrates Court.

The police force of Madhya Pradesh was able to recover the laptop and the cell phone that were stolen.
The deputy inspector general, D.K. Arya, said: "We have arrested five individuals who abused the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop computer."
Baba, Bhutha, Rampro, Gaza, and Vishnu Kanjar are the accused.
According to the superintendent of police, Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the accused presented themselves before the court with their faces covered.
Despite the fact that there were three people in the house at the time of the impact of the car, none of them suffered injuries.
However, the driver suffered serious injuries to his head.
The road where the accident took place was closed temporarily while emergency services removed the driver of the Audi TT red.
In the beginning, he was transferred to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Then he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been on trial in the county court of Edinburgh, accused of the murder of her son.
While she is in custody awaiting trial, any eyewitness testimony may be questioned, as her image has been widely disseminated.
It's a common practice in other parts of the United Kingdom, but as the Scottish justice system works differently, the courts considered the publication of photographs as potentially prejudicial.
Pamela Ferguson, a professor at the University of Dundee, said: "Journalists seem to be walking on dangerous ground when they publish photos or other information about suspects."
The Office of the Crown, which is in charge of the proceedings, said that it would not make any further comments until the auto de procesamiento is issued.
According to the information that was leaked, the document will deal with the border conflict, which Palestine intends to resolve based on the existing boundaries prior to the Six-Day War of 1967.
Other topics that were also addressed, according to the report, include the future state of Jerusalem, which both nations consider sacred, and the problem of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for 10 years once the agreement is signed, while PA only accepts five.
During the supplementary control of pests, the game wardens had to supervise closely the shooters, given that they were monitored and evaluated.
In a partnership between NPWS and the New South Wales Association of Sporting Shooters (NSW) Inc., volunteers were recruited within the Association of Sporting Shooters.
Mick O'Flynn, who is in charge, provisionally, of the Conservation and Heritage Office of the NPWS, noted that a comprehensive training and safety program was provided to the four shooters selected for the operation.
Yesterday, Martelly swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP, for its English acronym) of nine members.
In four years, it's the fifth CEP of Martelly.
Last month, a presidential commission advised the CEP to resign, in the context of a series of measures that seek to lead the country to new elections.
The commission was the way that Martelly responded to the generalized protests that began in October against the regime.
Demonstrations, sometimes violent, were provoked by the fact that elections are not being carried out, in some cases since 2011.
More than 60 cases of iPods with problems of malfunctioning and overheating have been reported, which have caused six fires and minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) reported that it had registered 27 accidents involving these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 additional incidents of overheating, which the company classified as "non-serious."
The ministry said in relation to the delay in Apple's report, saying it was "truly regrettable."
Mariana was shaken by a quake at 7:19 a.m. local time (21:19 GMT) on Friday.

In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former police officer kidnapped a bus and held tourists from Hong Kong.
Rolando Mendoza opened fire with his M16 against the foreign visitors.
Several hostages have been rescued and, so far, it has been confirmed that at least six have died.
Both the six hostages, including children and the elderly, as well as the Filipino photographers, were released early.
Later, the photographers took the place of an elderly woman because she needed to go to the bathroom. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began to study medicine.
She received training in obstetrics and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
Liggins began his research on premature birth in his free time, while working at the hospital.
His study showed that fetal lung maturation could be accelerated through the administration of a hormone.
Xinhua reported on Wednesday that investigators for the government were able to recover the flight data recorders from the black box.
Luna's fellow wrestlers also paid tribute.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first queen of the Extreme. She died the night of the two moons, something unique, as she was. A strong woman."
Dustin Oro in Dusty Runnels declared: "Luna was as rare as me; even more so. I love her and I miss her. I hope she is in a better place."
From 2008 to 2010, a survey of 1,400 people prior to the 2010 federal elections showed a 8% increase in those opposed to Australia becoming a republic.
Julia Gillard, interim prime minister, said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she considered Australia should become a republic once the reign of Queen Elizabeth II was over.
34% of those surveyed share this view and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last Queen of Australia.
On one end of the survey is a 29% of people who think that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible; on the other, a 31% who think it should never become a republic.
The winner of the Olympic gold medal in the 100-meter freestyle and 200-meter freestyle, and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but his physical condition has been put in doubt after his complaints.
He has not been able to take painkillers because it is prohibited to use them in the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
Many people verified the discovery through the use of various types of hardware and software at the beginning of February and it was made public on Tuesday.
It is possible that comets have served as a source of water for our planet, as well as organic matter, which has the ability to form proteins and support life.
The expectation of scientists is to understand how planets are formed, particularly our own, given that comets have crashed into the Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, who is 53 years old, took office at the beginning of the year and last month signed a law that allows people of the same sex to marry.
He characterized the rumors as "political gossip and nonsense."
It is speculated that he will run for the presidency in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the Federal Aviation Administration, would reduce the distances of air routes, which would save millions of gallons of fuel per year, as well as carbon emissions.
Using satellite technology, in contrast to the old technology of terrestrial radar, with the aim of enabling air traffic controllers to detect aircraft with greater precision and provide more accurate data to the pilots.
There will be no additional transport and the trains will not stop at Wembley. Parking for cars and the dissuasive will not be available.
Due to the concern generated by the possible lack of transport, it was considered the possibility that the game would be played closed doors, without the fans of the team.
On Thursday, the magazine Science published an article about the appearance of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands.
Experts from Princeton University, in the U.S., and from Uppsala University, in Sweden, announced that the new species evolved in just two generations, even though it was estimated that it would take much longer, due to the reproduction between a Darwin's finch endemic, Geospiza fortis, and a cactus finch migratory, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can take on any shape and can be rolled into tiny figures.
Not only can it be hammered and rolled into sheets, but it is also possible to stretch it into a very fine wire that can be twisted and braided.
It can be very thin and adhere to another metal. It is so thin that it can be used to decorate illustrations made by hand in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called the pH of a chemical substance. You can make a pH indicator using red cabbage juice.
The color of the cabbage juice will be altered depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical substance is.
The number of ions of hydrogen (H in pH) present in the chemical product determines its level of pH.
Hydrogen atoms are formed by a proton and an electron. Therefore, an ion of hydrogen is the result of depriving a proton of its electron.
Shake both dry powders together and, after doing so, with clean and wet hands, squeeze them to form a ball.
There will be a reaction between the moisture in your hands and their external layers, which will feel strange to the touch and will form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had in-house toilets with drainage in almost all houses, which were connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
In some homes of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece, were found traces of sewer systems.
They also had sanitary facilities in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In the Roman civilization, public baths had toilets and some were shared by men and women.
When one communicates with someone who is thousands of miles away, one is using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and, then, reflects it back almost instantaneously.
The satellite was sent to space through a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space, because the atmosphere of the Earth distorts part of the light and vision that we have.
A giant rocket is needed to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in surprising ways. The most important thing it has done for us is to give us a much simpler and faster way to travel.
Thanks to her, today we have many means of transport, such as the railway or the car, among many others.
Below, there are medium-sized felines that feed on medium-sized prey, from rabbits to deer and elk.
Finally, there are many small wild cats (including domestic cats) that feed on smaller species that exist in much greater numbers, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of its success is the concept of niche: each cat has a particular function, which prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the big cats that socialize the most and their lives take place in large groups called prides.
Manes are formed by one to three adult males of the same family group, united with up to thirty females and their offspring.
Generally, females are closely related to each other, which makes them a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides have the same behavior as wolves or dogs, with which they have a surprising similarity (unlike the other great cats) both in their behavior and in that they are highly lethal to their prey.
Tiger has the ability to climb (but not very well), swim, jump, and pull five times stronger than a strong person.
The tiger is of the same genus (Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These are the only four big cats capable of roaring.
The roar of the tiger is not a fully-sonorous roar like that of the lion, but rather a series of words spoken in growls and shouts.
Ocelots enjoy eating small creatures. As far as possible, they will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Almost all their prey will be much smaller than them.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find prey (prey) using their sense of smell, smelling the ground where they have passed.
They have very good night vision and in dark places and, in addition, they move very quietly. Ocelots hunt their prey by mimicking their surroundings and then pounce on them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) moves away from the main one (for example, if they move to a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island), they will often find themselves in a different environment than the one they were used to.
The new environment has different resources and competitors, so a new population will need different characteristics or adaptations than before to be a strong competitor.
No changes have been made to the original population, which still require the same adaptations as in the past.
As time goes by, as the new population adapts to the new environment, it begins to look more and more like the other population.
Finally, after millions or even billions of years, the two populations will be so different that they will no longer be able to be classified as the same species.
This process receives the name of speciation, which simply means the development of new species, and is an ineludible consequence and part of the evolution.
Plants generate the oxygen that people breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that they exhale (which they exhale).
The food of plants is generated with solar energy, thanks to photosynthesis. In addition, they offer us shade.
We build our houses from plants and with them we also make clothes. The majority of the food we eat are plants. Without them, animals would not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the alpha predator of its time, so it had nothing to fear, except for other members of its own species.
His long jaw had more than 70 sharp teeth like knives, in addition to another group of teeth in the palate, which means that anything that happened to him, had no escape.
We don't have the security, but it could have had the viperine. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurids, and even could have been a cannibal.
He also attacked any creature that entered the water: not even the T. Rex was a threat to him.
While the majority of that food would be familiar to us, the Romans also ate some unusual items at their banquets, such as wild boar, pheasants, snails, and even a type of rodent, the lizard.
Another difference was that the poor and women ate sitting in a chair, while the wealthy and men enjoyed sharing banquets and lying down while eating.
It is not possible that the recipes of the ancient Rome include foods that came to Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
In other words, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no chocolate, and no Romans ever tasted a pheasant.
The Babylonians built for each of their gods a central temple considered their home.
People brought sacrifices to the gods and priests sought to satisfy the needs of those celebrating ceremonies and festivals.
Temples have an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary where only the priests could enter.
In some cases, pyramidal towers were built, called ziggurats, to be part of the temples.
The upper part of the tower was a special sanctuary for his deity.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not of major importance.
Hebrew families spent most of their time outdoors.
The women cooked in the patio; the shops were only showrooms that gave to the street. The houses were built with stone.
In the land of Canaan, there were no large forests; therefore, wood was very expensive.
Very few people lived in Greenland. According to the sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, during a journey that took him further west, discovered the island and gave it its name.
Even so, without prejudice to its discovery, the Eskimos already inhabited the place at that time.
Although each country was "Scandinavian", there were marked differences in relation to the people, the monarchs, the habits and the history between Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie Treasure of the Sierra Madre, you may believe that a map of the treasure was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. While the reverse of the document contains something written, it is not a map of a treasure.
The Declaration of Independence has written on its reverse the phrase "Declaration of Independence original of July 4, 1776." The text is written on the lower part of the document, upside down.
Although it is not known for sure who wrote it, it is known that the huge document (measures 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up to be stored.
Therefore, it is likely that the annotation has been added only as a label.
Although the landings carried out on D-Day, as well as the subsequent battles, had liberated the north of France, the south still remained.
His government was in the hands of the French of "Vichy", which was a group that, in 1940, had agreed to peace with the Germans and worked with the invaders instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, the "Operation Dragon" was launched, through which the Allies invaded the south of France.
In only two weeks, the American and French forces had liberated the south of France and were on their way to Germany.
A civilization can be defined as a specific culture of a large group of people who live and work together; in other words, a society.
The term civilization derives from the Latin civilis, which means civil, and is related to the word civis, from the same language, which means citizen, as well as civitas, which means city or city state, and which, in addition, determines the size of the society.
State capitals are the precursors of nations. A culture of civilization entails a long-term transmission of knowledge, a durable cultural legacy, and a homogenous propagation.
Minority cultures tend to disappear without leaving relevant historical traces, and are not recognized as civilizations.
During the American Revolution, the thirteen states formed, at first, a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation, in which the Congress was its only component.
The Congress did not have the power to levy taxes and, given that it had a national executive or judicial power, such a function fell to the authorities of the states, which often did not cooperate to enforce all of its laws.
He was not authorized to annul tax laws or tariffs between states.
The articles demanded unanimous approval of all states to proceed with their amendment and the states gave so little importance to the central government that their representatives often absented themselves.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second team with the most wins in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among the sports that are most practiced are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, figure skating and Formula 1.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern zones, with athletes who participate in international tournaments and Olympic games.
In Japan, there are about 7000 islands (the largest island is Honshu), which makes it the seventh largest archipelago in the world.
Due to the conglomerate/group of islands that it contains, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago", from a geographical point of view.
The history of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when the sailors of Europe who sailed through the place registered the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, which means Beautiful Island.
The establishment, in 1624, by the Dutch East India Company, of a base in the southwest of Taiwan, marked the beginning of a transformation in the aboriginal method of grain production, with the employment of Chinese labor to work in their rice and sugar plantations.
The army of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the coastal and western region of Taiwan in 1683 and declared it as a dependent province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after having been defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, through which it ceded sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which retained control over the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three main buildings: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings have been reconstructed at the ends of the complex so that tourists can see how they looked originally.
By 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu had been restored, and work continues to this day.
To illustrate, the most common format for fixed-image photography is 35 mm, which was the size of film most commonly used toward the end of the era of film photography.
Today it is still produced, but the most important thing is that its dimensional relationship has been transferred to digital image sensors of cameras.
In truth, the format of 35 mm is confusing, as its measurements are 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
Therefore, it is said that the dimensional relationship of this format (dividing by 12 in order to calculate the simplest rational number) is equivalent to 3:2.
Many typical formats (for example, the APS group) are similar or very similar to this relationship of appearance.
The rule of thirds, which has been the subject of constant ridicule and often mocked, is a simple pattern that generates dynamism while also allowing for some order in the images.
Indicates that the most effective position where to place the central object is the intersection formed by the horizontal and vertical lines that divide the image into thirds (see example).
During this phase of the history of Europe, the Catholic Church, which had accumulated wealth and power, was questioned.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity had been able to unite European states despite their different languages and customs.
His power, present everywhere, affected everyone, from the monarch to the commoner.
One of the most important principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the funds of the church are reserved for that specific function.
The central leadership of the church had remained in Rome for more than a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money made many wonder if this principle was being respected.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, the British began a naval blockade of Germany.
Although the strategy, which involved the interruption of military and civilian vital supplies, was successful, this measure violated the generally recognized international general right and was contained in several international agreements of the last two centuries.
Britain extracted international waters in complete sectors of the ocean to block the entry of ships, even risking the safety of neutral ships.
Having received a reduced response to this tactic, Germany thought that it would face a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the attitude adopted by the majority of citizens and nations was that of pacifism and isolation.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities that occurred during the First World War, the countries wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the U.S. to take a job at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the U.S. with 4 cents, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation made by Charles Batchelor (his manager in his last job) and addressed to Thomas Edison.
The ancient China had a unique way of delimiting the different periods of time. Each stage or each family in power constituted a different dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there was also a period of instability, with provinces divided. The most well-known was the Three Kingdoms, which lasted for 60 years, between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these stages, a bloody war broke out between many nobles who were fighting for the throne.
One of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China was the Three Kingdoms, in which thousands of people died in a struggle for the throne of the great palace in Xi'an.
There are many of its political and social consequences, such as the use of the metric system, the displacement of absolutism towards republicanism, nationalism and the conviction that the country belongs to the people, and not to a single sovereign.
Likewise, after the Revolution, the posts were open to all male candidates, which allowed for the success of the most ambitious and prestigious.
The same thing happens with the military, because instead of basing the charges of the army on classes, now they are based on the caliber.
The French Revolution was also a source of inspiration for many other people of the working class who rebelled against their own revolutions.
Mohammed was deeply interested in matters beyond this earthly life. He often visited a cave that became known as "Hira" in the mountain of "Noor" (light) to reflect.
The cave in itself, which lasted in time, illustrates very realistically the spiritual inclinations of Mohammed.
At the peak of one of the mountains to the north of Mecca, and lies a cave completely isolated from the rest of the planet.
In fact, it is very difficult to find, even if one was sure of its existence. Inside the cave, isolation is total.
Nothing can be seen more than the wonderful clear sky and the many mountains in the vicinity. From the inside of this cave, you can see or hear very little of this world.
Of the seven wonders, the only one that is still standing is the Great Pyramid of Guiza.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptian people in the 3rd century BC, is one of the many pyramidal structures built to venerate the deceased pharaoh.
The Necropolis of Guiza, or "Valley of the Dead", in the Valley of the Dead, in Egypt, contains numerous pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of the pharaoh Khufu, and many others of this type, tombs and smaller temples were built in honor of his wives and relatives.
The mark of "upward arc" is similar to a V and the mark of "downward arc" is similar to a grapheme or a square without its lower border.
Above means to start at the tip and push the bow, and below means to start at the frog, where the hand holds the bow, and pull the bow.
The ascending arc generates a softer sound, while a descending arc is more forceful and abrupt.
Feel free to make your own marks with pencil, but don't forget that the marks on the bow have been printed in that place for a musical purpose and, therefore, should be respected.
On October 6, 1789, a crowd of women from the market forced the terrified King Louis XVI, his wife Marie Antoinette, their two small children (Maria Teresa, 11 years old, and Luis Carlos, 4 years old), and the king's sister, Madam Elizabeth, to return to Paris from Versailles.
They returned to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd that shouted and threw threats at the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriage completely.
At some point, a participant in the revolt shook the head of a real guard executed in Versailles in front of the queen, who was in panic.
The Filipino people paid the costs of war for the imperialism of E.E. U.U. in the conquest of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the U.S. with the purpose of paying most of the expenses and interests of the bonds that fluctuated in the name of the Filipino government in the banks of Wall Street.
From now on, the super profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would be the main profits of the American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context that gave rise to the establishment of the order.
The historical period in Europe in which these events take place is known as the Middle Ages, between the years 1000 and 1300.
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which, by convention, ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a concept that includes, pragmatically, a broad range of ideas, from the impetus or technological imperative to a strict sense of that there is a logic underlying the destiny of humanity and that it is related to the laws of science and how they are reflected in technology.
Almost all interpretations of technological determinism have in common two general ideas: that technological development unfolds on its own independent of any cultural or political influence and that, at the same time, technology has "effects" on the societies that are inherent and not socially conditioned.
As an example, one could argue that the existence of automobiles necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a national network of roads is not economically viable for a small number of cars, so new manufacturing techniques are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The widespread use of automobiles also generates a greater incidence of traffic accidents, which leads to the development of new techniques in the field of health to repair the damaged bodies.
The element of cultural determinism was very present in the romanticism, according to scholars like Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography molded people and, with the passage of time, developed customs and cultures related to that geography that, since they were in harmony with the location of that society, were preferred to laws that were imposed arbitrarily.
Just as Paris is known as the city of fashion today, Constantinople was known as such in feudal Europe.
His fame as the epicenter of luxury began approximately 400 BC and extended to approximately 1100 AD.
During the 12th century, its status decayed, especially due to the return of the Crusaders, who brought back gifts, such as silks and spices, which were valued more highly than the goods offered in the Byzantine markets.
The title of "capital of fashion" was transferred, from then on, from Constantinople to Paris.
The cusp of the Gothic style occurred in the period between the 10th and 14th centuries.
In the beginning, the form of dress received great influence from the Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to the slowness of the communication channels, western styles could take a delay of 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most significant advances of that time was that, as a result of the Crusades, people began to use buttons to fasten their clothes.
Agriculture of subsistence is understood as that whose objective is to produce enough food to feed only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Agriculture of subsistence is a simple practice, usually organic, that combines the use of stored seeds from the region's ecoregion with the rotation of crops or other comparatively simple methods to maximize production.
Historically, much of the principal activity of farmers was subsistence farming, which is still practiced in many developing countries.
Subcultures congregate individuals with similar ideas and feelings of marginalization by the standards of society and provides them with the opportunity to generate a sense of identity.
There are many factors that can distinguish subcultures: age, ethnicity, class, location, or gender of its members.
The characteristics that distinguish a subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, sexual, geographical, or related to religion or politics, or a mixture of factors.
It is common for members of a subculture to exhibit distinctive and symbolic use of their style, such as fashion, gestures, and slang.
One of the most commonly used mechanisms for graphing the importance of socializing is to analyze the few and lamentable cases of children who, through negligence, bad luck or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults during their growth.
These children are called "wild". Some wild children are confined by people, usually their parents. In some cases, the abandonment of a child is due to the rejection of the parents of a child with intellectual disability or severe physical disability.
It is possible that wild children have suffered traumatic situations or severe child abuse before they were abandoned or fled.
It is said that others were raised by animals and that some have lived on their own in the wild.
When the wild child is raised exclusively by animals different from humans, it presents behaviors (within its physical capabilities) almost equal to those of the specific animal that took care of it, as well as its fear or indifference towards people.
Even though the project-based learning should make the process easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a little further.
The scaffolding is not a learning technique; it is, rather, a support that provides assistance to those who are going through a new experience, such as the use of a new computer program or the beginning of a new project.
The scaffolding can be presented either in real or virtual form; to put it another way, a teacher is a type of scaffolding, but also is the small animated sticky note of Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are incorporated into the software and their function is to question, stimulate, or explain procedures that may have been complex for the student to understand on their own.
Children are welcomed into foster homes for a wide variety of reasons, from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment where there is no love, care, or education; but it happens.
We can perceive that the system of family reception provides a safe environment for these children.
The goal of our foster care system is to provide safe homes, loving foster parents, sustained education, and reliable medical care.
The objective of the family placement is to cover all the needs that were not met in the home of origin.
The internet unites and mixes components of mass communication and between people.
The different features of the Internet open up new dimensions from the perspective of the concept of uses and rewards.
For example, learning and socialization are significant incentives for the use of the internet (James et al., 1995).
During a study of the reactions of users to web sites conducted by Eighmey and McCord (1998), it was also detected the "personal participation" and the "durable relationships" as new motivational factors.
Through the recording of videos, important findings have been made in the interpretation of micorexpressions, which are movements in the face lasting only a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is claimed that, through the proper reading of their microexpressions, it is possible to detect if a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, explained the way in which those who cannot understand speech due to a brain injury can, nevertheless, evaluate the sincerity with precision.
It also suggests that the ability to interpret human behavior can be shared with animals, such as domesticated dogs.
Through the research of the 20th century, it has been shown that there are two types of genetic variation: hidden and manifest.
The process of mutation incorporates a new genetic variation; the process of selection removes that variation from that set of variations.
Segregation and recombination barter variation between one and the other generation after generation.
In the savannah, it is not easy for a primate, whose digestive system is the same as that of humans, to satisfy its amino acid needs with the vegetable resources available to it.
In addition, not doing so can cause serious problems: slowing growth, malnutrition and, in the end, death.
Proteins present in the leaves and legumes would have been the easiest source of vegetable protein, but they are not easily digestible for primates like us, except when cooked.
On the other hand, foods derived from animals (ants, termites, eggs) are easy to digest and provide a large number of proteins that contain all the essential amino acids.
In the end, it shouldn't surprise us if our own ancestors resolved their "protein problems" in the same way that chimpanzees in the savannah do today.
Interrupting sleep consists of waking up on purpose during the normal sleep period and going back to sleep after a short time (10 to 60 minutes).
This can be easily achieved with a more or less soft alarm clock that makes him return to a conscious state, although without waking him completely.
The registration is an additional requirement for the visa process. In some countries, you will have to register your presence and the address of your accommodation with the local authorities.
Other options that are based on the biological rhythm consist of drinking a lot of liquid (especially water or tea, known diuretic) before going to bed, which will force you to get up to urinate.
The level of inner peace that a person enjoys is inversely related to the amount of tension in their body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive is the force of life with which we can cope. Each of us has the potential to find absolute peace and happiness.
We can all achieve enlightenment. The only thing that obstructs the path is our tension and negativity.
Although the bases of Tibetan Buddhism are the teachings of Buddha, they spread through the path of love Mahayana and numerous techniques of yoga from India.
In general, the laísmo is very simple. It is based on the kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of love that encompasses everything.
In Kundalini Yoga, the energy Kundalini (illumination) is activated with yoga poses, breathing practices, mantras or visualizations.
Tibetan meditation focuses on the Devata Yoga. Through the visualization of different deities, the channels of energy can be unblocked, the chakras can be activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment can be developed.
The cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States was the result of facing a common enemy, Germany, during World War II. After the war, the clashes of system, process, and culture ended up distancing the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, those who were allies are now enemies, and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and would be fought with substitute militias, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, among many other places.
Due to the fact that for September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken, its only hope was to retreat and reorganize in the extension of the Romanian head of the bridge.
However, these plans fell into disuse almost overnight, when more than 800,000 Red Army soldiers from the Soviet Union invaded and formed the fronts of Belarus and Ukraine after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, bilateral agreements, and multilateral agreements.
Using ships to transport goods is a much more efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across the oceans.
Since always, the function of the navy has been to ensure that its country retains the ability to transport its population and goods, while at the same time interfering with the enemy's ability to do the same.
The campaign of the Atlantic North in the Second World War offers one of the clearest and most recent examples of this. The Americans were trying to transport men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean with the aim of supporting Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly submarines, was trying to cut off this circulation.
If the Allies had not been successful, Germany could have taken power in Britain, just as it did with the other European countries.
Apparently, goats were domesticated, for the first time, about 10,000 years ago, in the Zagros Mountains, in Iran.
With the purpose of easily obtaining their milk, hair, meat, and leather, the ancient peoples and tribes started to keep them.
Generally, domestic goats were gathered in herds that roamed the hills or other areas of grazing, often tended by herdsmen who were children or teenagers, similar to the most popular shepherd.
In England, railways had already been installed in the 16th century.
Even though the rails of the carriages were made of simple parallel boards of wood, they allowed the horses pulling them to achieve a greater speed and carry heavier loads than on the rougher roads of the day.
The incorporation of sleepers to keep the rails in their place took place quite early. However, gradually, it was realized that the rails would be more efficient if they were covered with iron on their upper part.
This became a common practice, although the iron caused greater wear on the wheels of the wagons, made of wood.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced with wheels made of iron and, in 1767, iron rails began to be used.
The first form of transportation that was known was walking. The human being began to do it in an upright position two million years ago with the appearance of the Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not have the habit of walking erect.
While traces of bipedalism have been found in Australopithecus fossils dating back to 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, it is possible that Sahelanthropus walked on two legs 7 million years ago.
We can begin to live a more friendly life with the planet, form part of environmentalist movements or, even, we can become activists and fight to ameliorate, in some measure, the future suffering.
It is, in many cases, like the asintomatic treatment. But if we are only looking for a temporary situation, we should find the root of the problems and try to deactivate them.
It is manifest that the world has suffered great changes, due to the technological and scientific advances of humanity, and the problems have intensified due to the overpopulation and extravagant lifestyle of people.
After being approved by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft was sent to the printer, John Dunlap, a few blocks away.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are now known as the "Dunlap Copies."
It was John Nixon who read the document for the first time and did so in the patio of the Independence Hall, on July 8.
On the 6th of July, a copy was sent to George Washington, who ordered that it be read to his army in New York on the 9th of July. On the 10th of August, another copy arrived in London.
The 25 photographs of Dunlap, which are known to still exist, are the oldest copies of the document. The original manuscript has been lost.
A large number of paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive today. They are the birds.
Many people don't see them as dinosaurs, because they have feathers and can fly.
However, there are many characteristics in birds that still make them similar to dinosaurs.
They have scaly skin and sharp claws, lay eggs and move on their hind legs like the T-Rex.
Currently, almost all computers work based on the manipulation of data coded under the binary system.
A binary number can only have one of two values, they are 0 and 1, and, according to computer jargon, these numbers are known as binary digits, or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be evident immediately. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are too common to be able to give an immediate diagnosis.
The clearest indicator of internal poisoning may be finding an open bottle of medicine or toxic cleaning products.
Read the label for specific information about the first aid specific to that specific poison.
Entomologists use the term "parasitic insect" in a formal sense to refer to this group of arthropods.
The word comes from its old relationship with chinches, a very developed species to parasitize humans.
The assassin and bedbugs are nidicolous; they are adapted to live in the nest or home of their host.
About 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) are reported in the U.S. each year, making it the most common neurological disease among young adults and middle-aged adults.
The central nervous system, a union of the brain, the spinal cord, and the optic nerve, is the object of attack in multiple sclerosis.
The studies indicate that women have twice the chance of men to suffer from EM.
A couple could conclude that raising a child would not be the most convenient for them or for the child.
These couples could choose to plan the adoption of a baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents renounce their parental rights so that a different couple can take care of the child.
The goal of science is to decipher the way the world works through the scientific method. In fact, this method serves as a guide for the majority of scientific research.
However, it is not an experiment, it is a test that is used to discard one or more of the possible hypotheses, making questions and observations that guide the scientific investigation.
The focus of both naturalists and philosophers was put on the classical works; especially, in the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle's thoughts, especially those of science and psychology, were accepted.
As the domain of the Greek language was decaying, the West distanced itself from its Greek roots both philosophically and scientifically.
Often, many rhythms present in physiological processes and in the behavior depend decisively on internal cycles and their production through biological clocks.
The periodic rhythms, which are not only reactions to regular external stimuli, have been recorded in almost all living beings, even in bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks oscillate on their own and have a free-running period, even if there are no external stimuli.
One of the key indicators that the DNA consisted of a type of genetic material was the experiment conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase inserted their own DNA into a bacterium using phages, or viruses.
Two experiments were performed in which they marked the DNA of the frog with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the DNA with radioactive sulfur.
Depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether it involves germ cells, the mutation can have various effects.
Only mutations in germinal cells can be transmitted to children, while mutations in other parts of the body can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism usually attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the natural landscape, which includes wild animal and plant life.
Some examples of possible activities in the place are: hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visits to parks, and study of information on the ecosystem.
An example is to visit, take pictures, and learn about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in their cars to go to their jobs, and they often cross paths with others whose jobs are in the place from which they just came.
In this dynamic transport system, everyone is somehow connected with a transport system based on the use of private cars, and supports it.
Currently, scientists argue that this massive economy of carbon has deprived the biosphere of one of its regular states that has contributed to the evolution of humanity for the last two million years.
They are all part of the society and use the transportation systems; and almost all complain about them.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear complaints about the quality of water or the collapse of bridges.
What is the reason that transportation systems give rise to such complaints and why do they fail daily? Are the engineers of transportation simply incompetent? Or is there something more substantial that is happening?
The flow of traffic is the study of the individual movement of drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them.
Unfortunately, it is not an easy task to study the flow of traffic, since it is not possible to make accurate predictions about the behavior of drivers.
Fortunately, there is a tendency in drivers to maintain a relatively consistent behavior, which allows traffic flows to have a logical consistency and can be approximated by a mathematical representation.
In order to graph more clearly the flow of traffic, relationships were established between the three most important elements: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships facilitate both planning and design as well as the operations of the road devices.
The first species to take flight were insects. This helped them to evade their enemies more easily and to find food and a mate more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back, sticking them to the sides of the body.
This gives them a wider range of possible small places to hide from predators.
Currently, the only insects that are unable to fold their wings are the anisoptera and the ephemeroptera.
Millennia ago, a man named Aristarchus commented that the solar system revolved around the sun.
There were those who shared their theory, but many others believed the opposite: that the solar system orbited the Earth, even the Sun and other stars.
This seems to make sense, since on Earth we do not perceive its movement, correct?
The Amazon river is the most caudalous and the second most extensive river in the world. It contains 8 times more water than the river that follows it in size.
In addition, the Amazonas is the widest river in the world, in some points with a width of up to six miles.
Of the total amount of water from the world's rivers that flow into the oceans, 20 percent comes from the Amazon.
The great Amazon River has a length of 6387 km (3980 miles) and receives water from thousands of smaller rivers.
While the pyramids of stone continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, they never surpassed the size or the sublime technique of their construction.
The old Egyptian town of the New Empire was amazed by the monuments of its ancestors, which dated back more than a thousand years.
With approximately 800 inhabitants, the Vatican City is the smallest independent country in the world and the smallest country in terms of population.
The Italian language is used in the Vatican, both to draft its regulations and to issue its official communiqués.
The language spoken daily by the majority of those who work in the state is also Italian, and the use of Latin is generally reserved for religious ceremonies.
All citizens living in the Vatican adhere to the Roman Catholic religion.
The basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper are known since antiquity, since all of them can be found in nature in their original form and are relatively easy to extract with rudimentary tools.
Aristotle developed the theory that everything is made up of a combination of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more similar to the states of matter (with the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, but at the same time, it had the theory that they transform into new substances that make up the things we see.
Alloys are, basically, a combination of two or more metals. Remember that the periodic table has many elements.
Metals are considered to be elements like calcium and potassium. From now on, there are also metals of the type of gold and silver.
It is also possible that there are alloys with the presence of small amounts of elements, such as carbon, which are not metallic.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter, composed of very small particles called atoms.
The size of atoms is so impressively small that the period at the end of this sentence could contain billions of them.
Because of this, when the pencil was invented, it gained many friends.
Unfortunately, as a result of the implementation of new writing methods, the pencil is used less and has lost its status.
Today, people write messages on the screens of their computers. They don't even need to approach a pencil.
The only question is what will happen to the keyboard when something new comes along.
The atomic bomb operates on the principle that it requires energy to form a nucleus with a large number of protons and neutrons.
It's similar to what happens when you roll a heavy car up a hill. Dividing the nucleus once more, it releases some of that energy.
The nuclei of some atoms are unstable, i.e. they tend to decompose with a minimum or almost no push.
The surface of the moon is composed of rocks and dust, and its outer layer is called the crust.
The crust has a thickness of about 70 km on the near side and about 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under the lunar maria and thicker under the highlands.
It is possible that there are more seas on the side closer to due to the fact that its crust is thinner, which facilitated the lava to rise to the surface.
Theories of content focus on finding out what attracts or pleases people.
These doctrines hold that people have certain needs or desires that have been internalized as they grew up to reach maturity.
These theories analyze what causes some people to want the things they do and what factors in their environment force them to do or not do certain things.
Two very well-known theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, there are two types of behavior when managers begin to lead their former colleagues. On one side of the spectrum, there is the attempt to continue to be "one of the boys" (or girls).
To managers in this category, it is difficult to take decisions that are unpopular with employees, impose disciplinary measures, conduct performance evaluations, assign responsibilities, and demand accountability from the staff.
At the other end of the spectrum, it mutates into a person who believes it is necessary to change everything that has been done until now and do it in its own way.
At the end of the day, the success and failure of the team is the leader.
This way of behaving often ends up distancing the leaders from the other members of the team.
The same standards of excellence that apply to conventional teams apply to virtual teams, although there are some small differences.
Often, members of a virtual team operate as a point of contact for their physical nearest group.
In general, they enjoy greater autonomy than members of a traditional group, because it is possible for their teams to meet according to different time zones, which, for example, might not be understood by the local management.
The existence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also an exclusive element of virtual teams.
The "invisible team" is the group in charge of management and to which each member reports. It is the one that sets the standards for each member.
What reason could an organization have for submitting to the process of establishing an organization of learning? One of the purposes of applying the concepts of organizational learning is to promote innovation.
When all the available resources are used appropriately in the operational departments of an organization, there is space for creativity and ingenuity.
As a result of this, it is possible that an organization that works as a team to overcome a difficulty of place to a new innovative process in order to meet the needs of customers.
In order for an organization to be innovative, leadership must first generate a culture of innovation, as well as a shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuous approach as a method used to help organizations to achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data offer factual evidence for a theoretical approach to cognitive research. Thus, they reduce the field of research and give it greater accuracy.
The correlation existing between brain pathology and behavior contributes to the research of scientists.
For a long time, it has been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in mental functions.
Thanks to the rise of new technologies, we have the opportunity to see and investigate structures and processes in the brain that have never been seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to develop simulation models, which help us to understand the mental processes.
Although artificial intelligence is often associated with science fiction, it is a specialty of great relevance within computer science, which is responsible for the behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in the field of AI involves the development of machines in order to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples of this include monitoring, planning and programming, the ability to respond to diagnostic queries and customer queries, as well as facial recognition, handwriting recognition, and voice recognition.
These issues have become separate disciplines, focused on offering solutions to real-world problems.
The system of artificial intelligence is now often used in the economy, medicine, engineering, and military, in the same way that it was incorporated into various applications of video games and personal computers.
Study abroad trips are an important part of every classroom. It is very common for a teacher to want to take her students to places that are not accessible by bus.
The solution comes from the hand of technology, through virtual tours. Students can observe the objects exhibited in a museum, visit an aquarium, or contemplate beautiful works of art sitting with their class.
Sharing a virtual excursion is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, the students at Bennet High School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the capital of the state and each year the website is updated, but the previous versions are kept online in the form of an album of memories.
Blogs can also contribute to improve the writing of students. Even though students usually start their blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, this usually changes with the presence of an audience.
Due to the fact that students tend to be the most critical readers, the writer of blogs begins to try to improve his writing, in order to avoid criticism.
In addition, blogging requires that students be more understanding of the world around them. The need to arouse the interest of the audience inspires them to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a resource that inspire collaboration and encourage students to deepen their learning beyond the typical school day.
The appropriate use of blogs can empower students to be more analytical and critical, through the active response to the contents of the Internet, they can define their positions in the context of the writings of others, and establish their perspectives on specific topics (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the captivating bilingual capital of Canada and is home to a variety of museums and art galleries that exhibit the history and the present of the country.
The Niagara Falls are more to the south and the north hosts the natural beauty without exploiting Muskoka and the extension that follows.
All these aspects, among others, are what make Ontario intrinsically Canadian to the eyes of foreigners.
The large areas more towards the north are sparsely populated and some are wild lands, almost uninhabited.
To make a comparison that causes great surprise to many: there are more African Americans in the United States than in Canada.
The location of the islands of East Africa is on the east coast of that continent, in the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar is, by far, the largest and a continent in itself if we are talking about wild life.
The majority of the smaller islands are independent states or associated with France and are popular for their beaches and luxury tourist complexes.
Islam was also brought to the lands by the Arabs and was imposed, to a large extent, in the Comoros and Mayotte.
The initial influence of Europe and colonialism took place in the 15th century, following the discovery, by the Portuguese explorer, Vasco da Gama, of the route that unites the Cape of Good Hope with India.
The region limits with the Sahel to the north, and with the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that all female visitors say that they are married, regardless of their real marital status.
It will also be useful to use a ring (just make sure it doesn't look too expensive).
Women need to be aware that cultural differences can provoke what they consider harassment, and that it is not uncommon for them to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be round in rejecting men and don't be afraid to defend your position (there are cultural differences or not, that's not correct!).
The founders of the modern city of Casablanca were the Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and the Phoenicians, Romans, and Carthaginians used it as a strategic port, called Anfa.
It was destroyed and rebuilt by the Portuguese with the name of the White House, but in 1755 it was abandoned after the occurrence of an earthquake.
The city was rebuilt by order of the Moroccan sultan with the name of Daru l-Badya and the Spanish traders who set up their businesses in that place called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the most boring places to go shopping in all of Morocco.
In the surroundings of the old Medina, there are many places where you can buy traditional Moroccan goods, such as earthenware pots, ceramics, leather products, water pipes and a whole range of knick-knacks, although everything is prepared for tourists.
Goma is a tourist point in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, close to Rwanda.
In 2002, the lava of the volcano Nyiragongo destroyed Goma and left much of its streets submerged, especially in the center of the city.
While Goma is relatively safe, any visit outside should be considered to take stock of the situation in the province of Kivu in the North.
In addition, the city is the base for scaling the volcano Nyiragongo and its gorilla trekking expeditions are among the most economical in Africa.
To travel within Goma, you can opt for a boda-boda (mototaxi). The regular fare (local) is CDF500 (Congolese francs) for a short trip.
This, coupled with the fact that it is relatively inaccessible, has given "Tombuctú" an image of an exotic and distant land.
Although today Tombuctú is a poor city, it still has an airport and its reputation makes it an attractive tourist destination.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in danger, due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the most important stops on the special Maravillas del mundo africano, by Henry Louis Gates, on PBS.
The city contrasts a lot with the rest of the country, as it has a more Arab style than African.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and extends along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park has a surface area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 ecoregions, in each of which a different wild life is developed.
This is one of the most important attractions in South Africa and is recognized as the main icon of the National Parks of South Africa (SANParks).
As in all of South Africa's nature reserves, there are daily fees for conservation and access to the park.
It is also convenient to buy a Wild Card that allows entry to selected parks in South Africa or to all the National Parks of the country.
The territory of Hong Kong takes the name of the island of Hong Kong, which is the destination of most tourists consider the main attraction.
A comparison has been made between the buildings that delimit the horizon of Hong Kong and a bar graph that is evident by the presence of the waters of the Victoria Harbour.
The best way to enjoy the best views of Hong Kong is to leave the island and head to the Kowloon waterfront, located in front.
It is in the reclaimed lands of the northern coast of Hong Kong where its urban development is most densely concentrated.
This is the site that the British conquerors adopted as their own. Therefore, if you want to see proof of the past colonial history of this region, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove forest in the world, with a length of 80 km (50 miles) from the coast to the interior of Bangladesh and India.
The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has declared the Sundarbans a World Heritage Site.
Despite this, the forests are not only mangroves, but also some of the last trees that remain of the imposing jungles that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 km2 and about a third of its extension is covered by water or swampy areas.
The Sundarbans have been, since 1966, a temple of wild life and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Bengal tigers in the area and about 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses depart from the bus station between districts (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those that travel to the east and to Jakar (also called Bumthang), leave between 6:30 and 7:30 a.m.
Due to the fact that buses between districts are often filled with passengers, it is recommended to buy a ticket in advance.
Almost all districts have the Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and durable.
Sharing a taxi ride is a fast and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (150 ngultrums) and Punakha (200 ngultrums).
The bridge of the river Oyapock is a cantilever bridge that crosses it, connecting Oiapoque, Brazil, and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 m, with a length of 378 m and two lanes of 3.5 m width.
Below the bridge there is a free space of 15 meters and, although its construction was completed in August 2011, it was not enabled for traffic until March 2017.
The full operation of the bridge is estimated for September 2017, which is when it is expected that the Brazilian customs controls will be completed.
The area that currently constitutes the east of Paraguay was inhabited by the Guaraníes, who were the most important indigenous group in that region and who lived as nomadic hunters, in addition to practicing subsistence agriculture.
The Guaycurú and Payaguá, who hunted, gathered, and fished as a means of subsistence.
Paraguay, formerly known as "The giant province of the Indies", was born in the 16th century, as a result of the encounter between the Spanish conquerors and the native Indian peoples.
The Spaniards began the stage of colonization, which lasted for three centuries.
Since Asunción was established in 1537, Paraguay has been able to preserve much of its indigenous idiosyncrasy.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and the best players in the world.
The most important tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
They can also see other tournaments and lower level games in other parts of the year.
On the website of the Argentine Association of Polo, you will find information about the tournaments and where to buy tickets for the polo games.
The value of the pound of the Falkland Islands (FKP), the official currency of the Falkland Islands, is fixed in equivalence with the British pound (GBP).
There is only one bank on the islands. There you can change your money. It is in front of the store FIC West, in Stanley.
Sterling is accepted in most places on the islands. In Stanley, you can also pay with credit cards or U.S. dollars.
There is a good chance that credit cards will not be accepted in the outer islands, but you may be able to use British or American money. Ask the owners in advance to be able to define the method of payment accepted.
It is practically impossible to change money from the Malvinas Islands outside the archipelago, so it is advisable to do so before leaving.
Due to the fact that Montevideo is south of Ecuador, there it is summer when in the northern hemisphere it is winter and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics, with frequent temperatures above +30° C during the summer.
The cold winter can be misleading: while it is very rare for temperatures to be below the freezing point, the wind and humidity interact to make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no specifically "rainy" or "dry" stations; the amount of rain is almost the same throughout the year.
While many animals in the park are accustomed to seeing people, life in the wild is still wild, so don't feed it or disturb it.
According to the authorities of the parks, must be kept at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters from other wild animals.
Despite how gentle they may appear, the truth is that bison, bighorn sheep, elk, bears, and many other large animals can be aggressive.
Hundreds of visitors suffer injuries each year by not maintaining a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially wild; therefore, respect their space.
Also, remember that odors attract bears and other wild animals, so you should avoid having or cooking foods that release a lot of smell and keep the camp clean.
Capital of Samoa, the city of Apia is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of about 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and is the capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, the port was the scene of a disastrous naval battle when seven German, American, and English ships refused to leave the port.
They sank all the ships, except for a British cruiser. More than two hundred Americans and Germans died.
