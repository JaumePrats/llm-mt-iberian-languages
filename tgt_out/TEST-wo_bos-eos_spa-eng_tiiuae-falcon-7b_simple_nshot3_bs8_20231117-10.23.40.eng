"Some studies suggest that the disease must decrease its lethality before it can cause a global epidemic," he said.
"We fear that patients could spread the disease if they continue with their daily routines, if the symptoms are mild."
"The Komen Foundation has a new policy that prohibits the granting of funds to organizations that are the subject of official investigation," said Leslie Aun, spokesperson for the Komen Foundation, as she explained that the new policy applies to the granting of funds to organizations that are the subject of official investigation.
[The] Komen Foundation's policy of defunding Planned Parenthood has been discredited by a congressional investigation into the way the organization reports and uses its funds.
[In his role as] the director of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, which is under the umbrella of the Energy and Commerce Committee, Stearns is conducting an investigation to determine if the taxes are being used to fund interruptions of pregnancies through Planned Parenthood.
46% of the votes, Mitt Romney won the Republican primary for President of Florida.

[The] movements of a magnitude greater than 7.0 that caused the phase change occurred on March 10, 2011, in the northeastern sector of the caldera of this volcano.
"Dark clouds" were seen at the base of the mountain, but they were not related to volcanic activity.
"Clouds" could have been a possible cause of confusion as to whether or not an eruption had actually occurred.
120-160 cubic meters of fuel were aboard when the ship broke down, and the strong winds and waves pushed it against the breakwater.
12 crew members were rescued by helicopters, and the only injury was a broken nose.
100-meter ship was heading to pick up its usual cargo of fertilizers, and at first there was concern that some cargo might spill.
 Both chambers approved the amendment in 2011.
 During this parliamentary session, a modification was introduced when the lower house eliminated the second sentence and, later, on Monday, the senate approved a similar draft.
[There is] the possibility that the elimination of the second sentence, which proposes to ban same-sex civil unions, will open the way for them in the future.
[After the process,] HJR-3 will be examined once more to remain in the process during the next legislative session, in 2015 or 2016.

"Karno" is a well-known, but controversial English teacher who taught at Modern Education and King's Glory and who claimed to have had 9,000 students at the peak of his career.
 In the notes, he used words that some parents thought were rude and, according to the reports, he also used bad words during class.
"Modern Education" accused him of publishing large advertisements on the buses without authorization and of lying when he said he was the principal instructor of English.
[He] was also accused of copyright infringement in the past, but no charges were brought against him.
"A former student said the man used 'lunfardo' language in the classroom, taught skills for using during dates, and acted like a friend to the students," according to the complaint.
(In the last three decades) China has developed a market economy, even though officially it still has a communist regime.
"Under the command of Deng Xiaoping, the first economic reforms were introduced."
[From there,] the economic volume of China has grown 90 times.
[China] exported more cars than Germany and the US for the first time, making it the most important market for the auto industry.
20 years from now, China's GDP could be higher than the US's.
2010 Atlantic hurricane season, Danielle was the fourth tropical storm to be named and originated in the eastern part of the Atlantic Ocean.
3000 miles from Miami, Florida, the storm has winds that reach a constant maximum speed of 40 mph (64 km/h).
"Hurricane Danielle is expected to intensify and become a hurricane by Wednesday," said the National Hurricane Center.
[Because] the storm is far from the ground, it is still difficult to analyze the potential impact it will have on the United States or the Caribbean.
"Bobek", a Croatian footballer, became popular when he joined the Partizan of Belgrade.
1945 was the year they joined and stayed there until 1958.
403 goals in 468 games.

13-year-old Peter Lenz, a motocross racer, died after participating in an accident at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
(During his return trip in the heat, Lenz fell off his bike and was then run over by his companion, Xavier Zayat.)
 He received immediate medical attention on the runway and was transported to a local hospital, where he later died.
"Zayat was not injured in the accident."
"Zapatero continued saying, in reference to the global financial situation, that "the financial system is a component of the economy, which has a major importance."
"We've been living through an economic crisis for a year, and the last two months have been the worst. I think that, currently, the financial markets are starting to recover."
"Last week, Naked News (Noticias al desnudo) announced that it would be raising its international language mandate to communicate news, to which it will add three new broadcasts."
[This] global organization, which already provides news in English and Japanese, is activating programs in Spanish, Italian and Korean for television, internet and mobile devices.
(I'm) lucky, but I saw a terrifying scene when people tried to break the windows to escape.
"Even though people were using chairs to break the windows, the windows were impossible to break."
"A survivor, Franciszek Kowal, said one of the glass panels finally broke and began to escape through the window."
 The light and heat that emanates from stars is generated when hydrogen atoms fuse (or combine) to form heavier elements.
 Scientists are working to develop a reactor that can generate energy in the same way.
[Despite] this, it is a very difficult problem and it will not be possible to build fusion reactors useful for energy production until many years from now.
(The needle floats on the surface of the water.)
"Tension" is the force that holds the water molecules together.
"Water molecules form an invisible film on its surface that allows objects like needles to float on top of it."
[The blade of a modern ice skate has two edges separated by a concave space between them, which allows for better adherence to the ice, even when the blade is inclined.]
(The lower edge of the blade is slightly curved, so when you tilt it to one side or the other, the edge that touches the ice also curves.)
"This makes the skater turn. When the skates lean to the right, the skater also turns to the right; if they lean to the left, they will turn to the left."
 To recover the previous energy level, they must get rid of the extra energy they received from the light.
"Photons" are emitted by emitting a small particle of light called a "photon".
"Emission-stimulated radiation" is the process by which a photon is emitted from an atom.
(In the image that follows, atoms are shown emitting photons. Of course, these are much smaller than the ones in the image.)
 The size of photons is even smaller than the size of the atoms that make up matter!
 After hundreds of hours of use, the filament in the light bulb eventually burns out and stops working.
(After the bulb is changed) Be careful when replacing the bulb.
1st thing to do with a lamp is to turn off its switch or unplug it.
..because the electricity that runs to the part of the headlight that is inserted into the metal casing can cause a serious electrical shock if you touch the inside of that casing or the metal base of the headlight while it is partially inserted into the casing.
"The heart, which pumps blood, is the most important organ of the circulatory system."
"Blood flows from the heart through arteries and returns to it through veins. The smallest of all vessels are called capillaries."
 With its teeth, a triceratops could have crushed not only leaves, but also very hard branches and roots.
 According to some scientists, Triceratops ate cicadas, a common plant in the Cretaceous period.
 These plants look like a small palm tree with sharp leaves.
"The Triceratops could have eaten the leaves with its robust horn instead of eating the trunk."
"Other scientists argue that few dinosaurs would have eaten these plants, given that they are highly poisonous; however, today, the lazy and other species, such as parrots (which descend from dinosaurs), can eat poisonous leaves or fruits."
"What effect would Io's gravity have on me? If you were on the surface of Io, your weight would be less than on Earth."
200 pounds (90 kg) on Earth would weigh 36 pounds (16 kg) on Io. That means, of course, that Io's gravity exerts less attraction.
 The Sun doesn't have a crust like the Earth, on which one can stand. It is composed entirely of gases, fire and plasma.
 As it loses proximity to the sun, the gas becomes lighter.
"The part of the sun that can be seen when looking at the sun is called the photosphere; that is,'sphere of light'."
3,000 years later, in 1610, the Italian astronomer, Galileo Galilei, was able to observe, through the telescope, that Venus had phases, just like the moon.
"Phases" of the moon are caused by the fact that only the illuminated side of the moon is visible to us. This phenomenon supported the Copernican theory that the planets orbit the sun.
1639, Jeremiah Horrocks, an English astronomer, was able to see a transit of Venus.
 After reconquering Danelaw, England had enjoyed a long period of peace.
991, Ethelred fought the largest Viking fleet since Guthrum's in the previous century.
"Olaf Trygvasson, a Norwegian with a taste for recovering his nation from the Danish dominion, was the leader of the fleet.
 After facing initial military setbacks, Etelredo was able to reach an agreement with Olaf, who returned to Norway to try to regain his kingdom, with mixed results.

4th king of the Joseon Dynasty, Sejong, was one of the most respected.
"Hangeul" is the Korean name for the Korean alphabet. It means "the correct sounds for instructing the people."
 There are many theories about how Sanskrit came to exist. One of them speaks of a migration of Aryans from the west to India, which brought with them the language.
"Sanskrit is an ancient language, comparable to Latin spoken in Europe."
 The first book that we have knowledge of was written in Sanskrit. After the compilation of Upanishads, this language simply disappeared, for reasons of hierarchy.
(Sanskrit) Sanskrit is a complex and rich language that served as a seed for many modern languages of India, including Latin which is the source of European languages, such as French and Spanish.
[After the Battle of France, Germany started planning the invasion of Britain.]
"Operation Sea Lion" was the code name for the German invasion of Britain. The British army was quite weak, as it had lost most of its heavy weapons and supplies during its evacuation from Dunkirk.
[But] the Royal Navy was still much stronger than the German Navy (Kriegsmarine) and would have destroyed any invading fleet that tried to enter through the English Channel.
[Despite this], there were very few bases of the Royal Navy that were located near possible invasion routes, because the admirals feared that the German air attack would sink them.
[We'll] start by explaining Italy's plans. Basically, Italy was the "little brother" of Germany and Japan.
 His army and navy were weaker, but four new ships were just being built before the start of the war.
[Italy] had as its primary objective to capture the African countries. To do so, it would need a platform for launching troops into the Mediterranean Sea so that these troops could invade Africa.
[The Italians] had to get rid of the bases and the British ships in Egypt. It was supposed that, apart from these measures, the Italian battleships had nothing more to do.
[Now, Japan. This is an island country, like Britain.]
 Submarines are ships designed to move and remain underwater for a long period of time.
 During World War I and II, submarines were used. They were very slow and their range of fire was very limited.
[At the beginning of the war, submarines traveled mainly on the surface of the sea, but as radars and sonars became more precise, submarines were forced to dive to avoid detection.]
"U" is the German word for "under" and "Boot" is the German word for "boat". The Germans were very good at navigating and operating their submarines.
[Given their success with submarines], since the war, the Germans have not generated confidence that they have large numbers of this type of ships.
"Yes!" One of the most famous kings of ancient Egypt in the modern world is King Tut, sometimes called "Tutankhamun" or "the boy king."
[It's] interestingly, in antiquity it was not considered of much importance and in most of the lists of the ancient kings it was not registered.
[However,] he became famous after his tomb was discovered in 1922. While many ancient tombs were looted, Tutankhamun's tomb remained almost intact.
[The majority of the objects buried with Tutankhamun have been preserved in good condition, including thousands of artifacts made with precious metals and exotic stones.]
 The invention of the wheel changed the chariots of the Assyrians into lighter, faster, and better prepared vehicles to leave behind other chariots and cars.
[The] deadly arrows from the bows could penetrate the armor of the enemy soldiers. Around 1000 BC, the Assyrians introduced cavalry for the first time.
"A cavalry is a mounted force of combat. In those times, there were no horses; the Asirian cavalry rode on the bare backs of horses."
 We know many politicians, men of science, and Greek artists. It is likely that the most famous figure of this culture is Homer, the proverbial blind poet, writer of two poems, masterpieces of Greek literature: the Iliad and the Odyssey.
 Sophocles and Aristophanes are still famous for their plays and their works are considered to be among the best in the world.
[Pythagoras] was a Greek mathematician, best known for his theorem about the relationship between the lengths of the sides of a right triangle.
[There are] several estimates about the number of Hindi speakers. It is estimated that Hindi is the second or third most spoken language in the world.
"Native speakers" will be different depending on whether dialects that are very related to each other are included or not.
340 to 500 million people speak Spanish, and up to 800 million can understand it.
 While Hindi and Urdu are similar in vocabulary, they differ in the way they are written. In everyday conversations, speakers of both languages can generally understand each other.
(German) The German culture had a strong influence on the northern part of Estonia in the 15th century.
 Some German monks wanted to bring God closer to the people of Estonia, so they invented the Estonian language.
"O" was added to the alphabet to represent the sound "o" in Spanish.
(With the passing of time) many words taken from German fused together to form the word "illumination".
[It is tradition that] the future successor to the throne enlist directly in the army after finishing his/her education.
 However, Charles attended Trinity College, Cambridge. There he studied anthropology and archaeology and, later, history, receiving a 2:2 (a second class lower degree).
 Charles was the first member of the British royal family to earn a university degree.
3% of Turkey is in the Balkans.


37th largest country in the world, about the size of France and the UK combined.
3 of the sides of Turkey are bordered by seas: the west, by the Aegean Sea; the north, by the Black Sea and the south, by the Mediterranean Sea.
(Although Luxembourg has a long history, its independence did not occur until 1839.)
(In the past) The parts of Belgium that are now part of Belgium were once part of Luxembourg, but after the Belgian Revolution of the 1830s, they became Belgian.
[Luxembourg] has always tried to remain neutral, however, Germany invaded it in both world wars.
1957 Luxembourg became a founding member of what is now called the European Union.
"Drukgyal Dzong" is a ruined fortress and Buddhist monastery located in the north of the Paro district in Phondey village.
1649, Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel built the fort with the purpose of commemorating his victory over the Mongol-Tibetan army.
"The portrait of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal is one of the few relics that remain from the Drukgyal Dzong, which was destroyed in a fire in 1951."
[After the fire,] the fort was preserved and protected, and it remains one of the most formidable attractions in Bhutan.
(The Kingdom of Cambodia was cornered between two powerful neighbors during the 18th century. They were Thailand and Vietnam.)
18th century Cambodia was invaded by the Thai, who destroyed Phnom Phen in 1772.
18th century Cambodia also suffered Vietnamese invasions.
18% of Venezuelans are unemployed and the majority of those who are employed work in the informal sector.
2/3 of Venezuelans work in the service sector, 1/4 work in industry, and 1/5 work in agriculture.
"Petroleum is an important industry in Venezuela, where the country is a net exporter, although only 1% of its population works in this sector."
[After] Singapore declared its independence, the expertise of the Singapore Botanic Gardens helped transform the island into a tropical garden city.
1981, Singapore chose the Singapore Orchid as its national flower.
1.5 million herbivores migrate southward each year, crossing the Mara River from the northern hills in search of the rains.
..and then return to the north by the west, again crossing the Mara River, after the rains, in April.
 In the Serengeti region of Tanzania, you will find the Serengeti National Park, the Ngorongoro Conservation Area, and the Maswa Wildlife Reserve. In Kenya, you will find the Masai Mara National Reserve.
 Learning to develop interactive media involves traditional and conventional skills as well as the mastery of tools in interactive classes (graphic design, audio and video editing, narrative, etc.).
"Interactive design requires you to reconsider your assumptions about the production of media and develop a non-linear thinking."
"Interactive design requires that the components of a project connect with one another, but that they also retain their sense of separateness."
 The negative aspect of the objectives with zoom is that the complexity of the focal length and the number of elements of the objective required to achieve a range of focal lengths is much greater than the number of elements required for the fixed focal length objectives.
[This problem] is becoming less important thanks to the fact that lens manufacturers are able to achieve higher standards in their production.
[This] has allowed the ZUM to produce photographs of a similar quality to those produced by the fixed-focus cameras.
 Another disadvantage of lenses with zoom is that the maximum aperture (the speed) of the lens is, in general, lower.
 This makes it difficult to use zoom lenses in low light or without a flash.
 One of the most common problems when converting a movie to DVD is over compression.
(Most) TV designs are aimed at pleasing the general public.
"That's why all the images on TV are cropped with the top, bottom, and sides cut off."
"This is done to ensure that the image is displayed in the full screen. This is called overscanning."
 Unfortunately, when creating a DVD, it is likely that the edges will be cut off and, if the video has subtitles near the bottom, they will not be seen in their entirety.
"The typical medieval castle has served as inspiration for long time and evokes images of jousts, banquets and Arthurian knights."
"Even stopped in the middle of ancient ruins, it's easy to imagine the sounds and smells of battles that happened long ago; almost hear the impact of the horses' hooves on the cobblestones and feel the fear that emerged from the dungeons.
"But, does our imagination have an anchor in reality? What was the reason for building castles in the first place? What method was used to design and build them?"
"Kirby Muxloe Castle" is not a castle, but a fortified house, typical of that time.
(His) large windows and thin walls would not have been able to withstand a determined attack for too long.
1480, when Lord Hastings began his construction, the country was quite peaceful and only needed defense against groups of wandering criminals.
"The balance of power was a system through which European countries sought to maintain the sovereignty of each of the states in that continent."
[The] governments of the [European] nations used to change their alliances in order to maintain the balance, since they shared the concept that all European nations should try to prevent one nation from becoming too powerful.
 The War of Succession of Spain was the first whose main objective was the balance of power.
[This] marked a change of great importance, as the European powers could no longer use the excuse of religious conflict. As a result, the Thirty Years' War would be the last war to be called a religious war.
356 BC, the temple of Artemis in Ephesus was burned down by Herostratus.
"They say that his motivation was to achieve fame at any cost, and that the Ephesians, outraged by this, announced that they would never register the name of Herostratus."
"The Greek Strabo, an erudite in history, later named his name, which is the one we know today. The temple was demolished the same night that Alexander the Great was born."
(Alexander the Great) offered to pay for the reconstruction of the temple, but his proposal was rejected. Later, after his death, the temple was rebuilt in 323 BC.
 Make sure your hand is as relaxed as possible while still playing the notes correctly. Also, try not to make too many strange movements with your fingers.
..
 If you want to increase the volume by playing the accordion, you must use the fuel with more pressure or speed.
"Mysticism" is the search for the connection, identity or conscious recognition of a supreme reality, divinity, truth in material or God.
"The desire of the believer is a direct experience, sensation or appreciation of the divine, god or deities."
"His followers propose to adopt certain ways of life or practices whose purpose is to nourish those experiences."
"Mysticism" can be distinguished from other types of beliefs and religious cults by its emphasis on personal experience of a unique state of consciousness, particularly those of a peaceful, wise, happy, or even euphoric nature.
"Sikhism" is a religious cult originating in the Indian subcontinent. It was founded in the 15th century in the Punjab region, the result of a division within Hinduism.
"Sijs" believe their creed is a religion separate from Hinduism, but recognize their origins and Hindu traditions.
"Sikhism" is the name of the religion of the Sikhs, who call it "the way of the Guru". The Guru is an essential aspect of all Indian religions, but in Sikhism it has acquired a special importance, forming the axis of the Sikh beliefs.
1469-1569 Guru Nank founded the religion in the 15th century and was followed by nine other gurus.
 However, in June 1956, the promises of Krushchev were put to the test when the disturbances in Poland led by workers protesting food shortages and wage cuts, led to a general strike against communism.
 While Kruschev sent tanks to restore order, he also made room for some of the economic demands and agreed to name the popular Wladyslaw Gomulka as the new prime minister.
[The] Civilization of the Indus Valley developed in the Bronze Age, in the northwest of the Indian subcontinent, which includes the majority of the present-day Pakistan and some areas of the northwest Indian and northwestern Afghan territories.
"Civilization flourished in the Indus Valley, from which it takes its name."
..despite this, some experts estimate that, due to the fact that civilization also existed in the now dry Sarasvati river basin, it would be more accurate to call it the Indus-Sarasvati civilization; on the other hand, others call it the Harappa civilization, which is the name of the first site to be excavated in the 1920s.
(The) martial nature of the Roman Empire contributed to the development of medical advances.
(Augustus) began recruiting doctors to form the first Roman Medical Corps, whose function was to intervene after battles.
[The] surgeons had knowledge of different sedatives, such as morphine extracted from poppy seeds or scopolamine extracted from jimsonweed.
..not only did they become experts in amputation to save those suffering from gangrene, but also in making tourniquets and arterial clamps to stop the flow of blood.
(With the passing of the centuries) The Roman Empire advanced widely in the field of medicine and developed much of the knowledge we have today.
"Pureland" is a type of origami that only allows for one fold at a time, no complex folds like the "inverted" are allowed, and all folds are simple.
"John Smith" was developed in the 1970s to help people with limited motor skills or those who are not very skilled at folding.
 From a very young age, children develop some awareness of race and racial stereotypes and these affect their behavior.
 For example, those small children who identify with a minority racial group and are exposed to a stereotype that they will not do well in school once they learn about it are more likely to fail in school once they learn about it.
 MySpace is the third most popular website in the United States and, currently, has 54 million profiles.
 These websites have attracted a lot of attention, particularly in the educational field.
..there are some positive aspects to these websites, such as the ability to easily set up a virtual classroom that can contain blogs, videos and photos, among others.
 This page is simple to access, as it has a single web address, which makes it easier for students who may have problems using the keyboard or spelling to remember it and write it easily.
 It's possible to personalize it to make it easier to read and, also, to regulate the presence of color, as desired.
"The attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by a persistent pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that interferes with functioning or development."
"It's not a learning disability, it's a learning difference; 'It affects between 3 and 5 percent of children, possibly up to 2 million in the United States.'"
 Children with TDA have difficulty concentrating on schoolwork, but they can concentrate on things they like, such as playing, watching their favorite cartoons, or writing sentences without punctuation.
"These kids tend to get into trouble because they adopt risky behaviors, get into fights, and challenge authority," says Dr. John Medina, a developmental molecular biologist and author of "Brain Rules." "The brain can't be stimulated by normal methods."
"The TDA affects the relationships with other children, because the other children do not understand why they act as they do, why they write the way they do, or why they do not share the same level of maturity."
 As the rate of acquiring knowledge and learning varied from the way described above, the base rate of knowledge acquisition also varied.
[The] approach to acquiring knowledge changed. The pressure no longer pointed to individual memory, but to the ability to remember the text.
[The] Renaissance was a change in the way we look at learning and the transmission of knowledge.
"Hominids" (humans) are the only primates that don't use their hands for locomotion or to swing from tree to tree.
 The fact that the hand and foot of the chimpanzee are of similar size and length suggests that they use their upper extremity as a support for their weight when walking on their knuckles.
 The length of the human hand is less than that of the foot and its fingers are straighter.
2-3 million year old hand bones show a change in use from locomotion to manipulation.
"Some people say that doing many sessions of artificial conscious sleep induction can be really exhausting."
 The main cause of this phenomenon is the product of lucid dreams, which extend the time between REM states.
[...], the less REM sleep you get at night, the less frequent this state is, which is when the body recovers its energy, becoming scarce enough to become a problem.
 It's just as tiring as waking up every twenty minutes or so and watching TV.
[The effect] will be in function of how often your brain tries to produce lucid dreams at night.
"Almost from the beginning, the Italians did not do well in North Africa. After a week since the country declared war on June 10, 1940, the 11th British Hussars had taken the Fort Capuzzo in Libya."
"The general Lastucci, the chief engineer of the Tenth Army of Italy, was trapped by the English during an ambush to the east of Bardia."
28 June 1942, the Italian general Italo Balbo was killed in a plane crash in Libya.
"Epee" is a modern sport, practiced at various levels, from students who exercise in university to olympic and professional competitions.
(The main way to practice this sport is through duels, in which two fencers face off.)
"Golf is a sport in which participants try to get balls into holes, using a club."
18 holes are played during a regular round of golf, and players generally start on the first hole and finish on the tenth.
 The player who hits the least number of strokes, or strokes with the bat, to finish the course.
"The game is played on grass, and the grass that surrounds the hole is cut shorter and is called the green."
"Perhaps, the most common type of tourism is the recreational one, which is related to the recreation."
"When travelers choose a destination very different from their usual one in order to relax and have fun."
"Beaches, theme parks, and campgrounds are often the places that most tourists visit for pleasure."
"Cultural tourism" is a type of tourism that involves visiting a particular site to learn about its history and culture.
[Tourists] can visit different reference points in a particular country or simply focus on a single area.
[Seeing this activity, the colonists also requested reinforcements.]
1st and 3rd New Hampshire regiments were reinforced with 200 men, under the command of John Stark and James Reed, who later became generals.
"The men of Stark spread out along the northern fence of the colonists' location."
[When] the tide went out, a crack opened along the Mystic River at the eastern end of the peninsula, and they quickly extended the barrier by building a low stone wall to the north that reached the edge of a small beach.
[Gridley or Stark] drove a stake into the ground about 100 feet (30 meters) in front of the fence and gave the order that no one was to fire until the regular army had passed.
 The US strategy was to launch coordinated attacks from three different points.
 General John Cadwalder would initiate a diversionary attack against the British troops in Bordentown, with the goal of blocking any type of reinforcement.
"General James Ewing avoided the escape of the enemy troops by taking the bridge over Assunpink Creek and guiding 700 soldiers across the river at Trenton Ferry."
2400 men led by Greene and Sullivan would cross the river nine miles north of Trenton to then divide into two groups, with the goal of launching an attack before dawn: one under Greene and the other under Sullivan.
 When the race changes from a quarter mile to a half mile, speed loses much of its importance, while resistance becomes absolutely necessary.
(From the start) A runner of the mile in the first category, who can run under two minutes, must have a good speed level, but must cultivate resistance at all costs.
"The best way to prepare for the racing season is a combination of some off-road running during the winter with a higher intensity training in the gym."
"It's not possible that the right nutritional practices alone will generate an elite performance, but they can have a big impact on the well-being of young athletes."
 Having an appropriate energy balance, adopting effective hydration habits and learning about the different aspects of supplementation can help athletes increase their performance and enjoy their sport more.
"Road running" is a relatively inexpensive sport; however, there are many misconceptions about the few equipment requirements to participate.
 There are articles that can be acquired if they are estimated to be necessary; however, most of them will have little impact on performance, or their impact will be minimal.
 Athletes may prefer a product even though it doesn't provide real benefits.
"The atom can be considered as one of the cornerstones for the construction of all matter."
[The atom is] a very complex structure that is formed, according to the simplified Bohr model, by a central nucleus around which orbit electrons; something similar to the planets that orbit the Sun. See Figure 1.1.
2 particles make up the nucleus; these are protons and neutrons.
 While neutrons have no electrical charge, protons have a positive charge and electrons have a negative charge.
(1) To examine the victim, you must first inspect the scene to ensure your own safety. (2) To examine the victim, you must first ensure your own safety.
"When approaching a victim, observe their position and any warning signals."
"If you try to help and get hurt, it may make things worse."
 The study determined that depression, fear and over-diagnosis of pain were involved in the relationship between pain and disability in patients with lumbar spine disorders.
"Only the effects of catastrophization, not depression or fear, were conditioned by structured, weekly, and regular sessions."
[Those who participated in regular activities] reported greater negative perceptions of pain, marking the differences between chronic pain and the sensation of discomfort present in their usual physical activity.
"Vision" is the ability to see.
 There are many different eye structures; their complexity varies depending on the needs of the organism.
[The] different constructions have different capacities, are susceptible of having different lengths and degrees of sharpness; also require a different processing to give meaning to the entrance and numbers different to work optimally.
"A population is the gathering of organisms of a particular species in a particular geographic area."
 When individuals in a population share a particular phenotypic trait in an identical manner, they are called monomorphic.
"Polymorphs" are those who exhibit various variants of a given trait.
"Warrior" ants also walk and make nests in different stages.
"During the nomadic stage, ants move by night and stop to camp during the day."
[The colony] starts a nomadic phase when food availability decreases. In this phase, they form temporary nests that are changed daily.
17 days is the average length of a stampede or wildebeest migration.
¿What is a cell? The term derives from the Latin word "cellula," which means "small room," and was first used by a microscopist while studying the structure of cork.
"The basic unit of all living organisms is the cell, and every organism is made up of one or more cells."
"Cells are basic and crucial to the study of life. In fact, they are often called 'the basic components of life.'"
 The nervous system maintains homeostasis through impulses that are sent to the entire body to ensure that blood flow is uninterrupted.
"These nerve impulses can be sent quickly through the body, which helps keep it safe from any potential threat."
"Although the areas that are hit by tornadoes are small, compared to other aggressive storms, they can destroy everything in their path."
 Tornadoes can uproot trees, rip off panels from buildings, and hurl vehicles into the sky. The most aggressive tornadoes last more than three hours.
480 km/h (133m/s; 300 mph)
(For) thousands of years and thousands of years people have been making and using magnifying glasses.
 However, the first true telescopes were developed in Europe, at the end of the 16th century.
 Telescopes used a combination of two lenses to make distant objects appear closer and larger.
"Selfishness and egoism will always be with us, and the essence of cooperation is that, when the majority benefits, there will always be more to gain in the short term if we act selfishly."
(With luck) most people realize that their best long-term option is to work in collaboration with others.
 Many people dream of the day when humans travel to another star and explore other worlds. Some wonder what is out there, others believe that there are extraterrestrials or other forms of life out there.
[But, if this happened, it would probably not last long. The stars are so far apart that there are billions of kilometers between them.]
"Will your grandchildren someday be on the top of an alien world, asking questions about their old ancestors?"
 Animals are made up of many cells. They ingest food and digest it in their interior. Most of them can move.
"Only animals have brains, but not all; jellyfish don't."
 Animals can be found in any corner of the planet: they dig in the ground, swim in the oceans and fly in the skies.
"Cell" is the smallest structural and functional unit that forms a living organism.
"Cell" is derived from the Latin word "cellula," which means "small room."
 If you look at a living organism under a microscope, you will notice that it is composed of small squares or spheres.
[Robert Hooke, a British biologist, observed small squares in the structure of a cork under a microscope.]
[They] looked like rooms. [They] were the first person to observe dead cells.
"Elements and compounds are capable of changing state without suffering alterations."
 Nitrogen gas is the same in both states. Although it is denser in the second state, the molecules do not change.
 Another example is water, which is made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.
[It] has the same molecular structure, whether it's in a liquid, solid or gaseous state.
"Although his physical state may vary, the chemical remains the same."
"Time is something present in all places and that has effects on all our actions, but it is difficult to understand."
 Both religious scholars and philosophers have studied time for thousands of years.
 We experience time as a series of events that pass from the future through the present to the past.
"Time" is also the way we compare the duration (extent) of events.
[It is possible] for you to mark the passage of time by observing a cyclic event; that is, something that happens regularly.
"People use computers to manipulate images and videos."
3D animation is becoming more and more common in television and movies.
"Recording music" is often done with sophisticated computers to process and mix sounds.
 For many years, during the 19th and 20th centuries, the belief was that the original inhabitants of New Zealand were the Maori, who hunted giant birds called moas.
[Later, the theory] established that the Maori had emigrated from Polynesia, aboard a Great Fleet, and had dispossessed the Moriori of New Zealand, establishing there an agricultural society.
 New tests suggest, however, that the Moriori were a group of Maori from New Zealand who left New Zealand and settled on the Chatham Islands, where they developed their distinctive peaceful culture.
[There was] also another tribe, formed by the Maori who left New Zealand, who settled in the Chatham Islands.
"They called themselves Moriori, then there were some fights and they were eventually eliminated."
 Those who were part of the organization for many years helped us to value our strengths and dedication, while also evaluating honestly the difficulties and even failures.
 While we listened to others tell their personal stories, about their families and about their organizational cultures, we collected information that was useful about the past and about some of the personalities that had effects, positive or negative, on the culture of the organization.
 Even though knowing personal stories doesn't mean you understand the culture, it at least helps individuals to be able to represent their place within the history of the organization.
 During the process of analyzing successes and failures, individuals and groups discover more deeply the values, the objective, and the forces that drive the organization.
[Here, remembering past corporate behavior, and the successes achieved through it, helped to open people up to new changes and directions for the local church.]
[These success stories] attenuated fears of change and created positive inclinations for change in the future.
 Convergent thinking is a method for solving problems that involves combining ideas from different fields or disciplines in search of a solution.
[The] central aspect of this way of thinking is speed, logic, and precision, as well as the identification of factual issues through the reuse of existing techniques and the collection of data.
"This type of thinking has as its principal premise the existence of only one correct answer. It is thought in terms of two possible answers, one correct and one incorrect."
"This type of thinking is related to certain sciences or standardized procedures."
 Those who think this way, have a logical mind, can remember patterns, solve problems and work in scientific experiments.
"Humans are, by far, the most talented species for reading the minds of others."
[This] implies that we have the capacity to make accurate predictions about the perceptions of other people, what they intend to do, their beliefs, knowledge and desires.
 Among these capacities, understanding the intent of others is crucial, as it allows us to resolve possible ambiguities in physical actions.
 For example, if you saw someone break a car window, you would probably assume they were trying to steal the car.
"I would judge him differently if he had lost the keys to his own car and was trying to get into someone else's."
[Magnetic resonance imaging] is based on a physical phenomenon called nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), which was discovered in the 1930s by Felix Bloch (who worked for Stanford University) and Edward Purcell (from Harvard University).
 During this resonance, the magnetic field and radio waves cause the emission, by the atoms, of very small radio signals.
1970, a doctor and scientist named Raymond Damadian discovered the basis for using magnetic resonance imaging as a diagnostic tool.
4 years after the invention, the first patent related to magnetic resonance was issued.
1997, Dr. Damadian finished building the first whole-body MRI scanner, which he named the "Indomitable".
"Asynchronous communication" encourages us to take time to reflect and respond to others.
"Self-paced" learning allows students to work at their own pace and control the pace of the instructional information.
..flexible work schedules are also possible. (Bremer, 1998)
 The use of the Internet and the world wide web allows students to have access to information at all times.
 Students can also send questions to instructors at any time of day and receive a reasonable response, rather than waiting until the next in-person meeting.
"Postmodern" learning focuses on the liberation of absolutes; there is no one correct way to learn.
"In fact, there is not just one thing that is good to learn. Learning happens through the interaction between the knowledge presented and the person who incorporates it."
 To illustrate this point, we need only look at our current experience with all the television programs that focus on learning, and bricolage and presentation of information.
 We've all been there, watching TV shows that provide information about processes or experiences that we'll never be able to apply.
 We will never repair a vehicle, build a fountain in the backyard of our house, go to Peru to examine ancient ruins, or remodel our neighbor's house.
93% of the population has access to the Internet, and the submarine fiber optic cables that reach Europe and the satellite broadband make it possible.
(If you are staying at a hotel or with a host family, they probably have wifi or a computer connected to the internet and all towns have a café with internet or some place with public wifi.)
"Eskimo" is still used in the United States, but many Arctic communities in Canada consider it offensive.
"Although it is possible to hear the term from the mouth of the Greenlandic, who come from other countries, it is best to avoid using it."
"Inuit" is the name of the people who live in Greenland. In Greenland, they call themselves "Inuit" and, in Greenland, "Kalaallit" (plural of "Kalaallit").
 Crime and animosity towards foreigners in general are practically non-existent in Greenland. Even in the cities, there are no "rough areas".
"Cold" is perhaps the only real danger that people who haven't prepared for it have to deal with.
 If you visit Greenland in the cold seasons (considering that the further north you go, the less the temperature will be), it is crucial to bring warm clothes.
(Long) summer days can make it difficult to sleep enough and cause other health problems related to sleep.
(During the summer) Also, you have to protect yourself from mosquitoes from the north, although they don't transmit any disease, they can be very annoying.
[Despite] San Francisco's economy being related to its global tourist attraction, the same is diverse.
 The most prominent industries are professional services, state employment, finance, commercial activities, and tourism.
 The fact that it is often evoked in songs, movies, literature and popular culture has contributed to its fame at a global level.
 With a great variety of hotels, restaurants and convention facilities, San Francisco has been developing a great tourist infrastructure.
[San Francisco] is also one of the best cities in the United States to find other types of Asian cuisine, such as Korean, Thai, Indian and Japanese.
"The trip to Walt Disney World is, for many families in the United States, a great pilgrimage."
"The typical" visit consists of flying to Orlando International Airport, taking a bus to a Disney hotel, staying around a week without leaving the area, and returning home.
 There are infinite variations possible, but this is what most people refer to when they talk about "going to Disneyland".
 Many of the passes available on the web, on auction sites like eBay or Craigslist, are multi-day Park Hopper passes, partially used.
"Despite being a very common practice, in Disney, passes are not transferable."
[You need a permit to camp below the rim of the Grand Canyon.]
[The purpose of protecting the canyon] is to limit the number of permits, which can only be requested on the first day of each month, starting four months before the start of the season.
[Therefore,] permits for crossing for all dates of start in the month of May will be available from January 1st.
[The] most popular areas, like the Bright Angel Campground, which is next to Phantom Ranch, fill up quickly.
 There is a limited number of permits, reserved for requests without an appointment, which are handed out in order of arrival.
 A great way to see the charm of the southern Africa region is to drive in a car, which will also allow you to access places outside of the usual tourist routes.
4x4s are recommended for this, but you can also do it in a regular car with careful planning. There are many places you can only access with a 4x4 with a large distance between the axles.
 When planning your trip, keep in mind that, despite the stability of South Africa, not all the countries that surround it are stable.
..the requirements and costs to obtain a visa will vary depending on the country from which you are applying and, in addition, will vary from country to country.
 In addition, each country has its own laws that determine what emergency items must be found in the car.
 Victoria Falls is a city in the west of Zimbabwe, passing the border with Livingstone, Zambia, and close to Botswana.
[The city] is located near the waterfalls, which are its main attraction, but this well-known tourist destination also offers, both to adventurers and travelers, a great number of options for a longer stay.
(November to March) During the rainy season, the water flow will increase and the waterfalls will be more impressive.
"Don't be surprised if you get wet if you cross the bridge or take the nearby trails near the waterfalls."
 On the other hand, it is precisely because of the high volume of water that your vision of the real cataracts will be obstructed by all the water!
"Tomb of Tutankhamun" (KV62). The "Tomb of Tutankhamun" is the most famous in the Valley of the Kings, the scene of Howard Carter's discovery in 1922 of the almost intact burial of the young pharaoh.
[However], compared to most other real tombs, the one of Tutankhamun is not worth visiting, given its size is much smaller and it is not very decorated.
[Anyone] interested in seeing the damage caused to the mummy during the attempts to remove it from the coffin would be disappointed, as only the head and shoulders are visible.
[Currently, the jewels of the tomb are not there, but they have been moved to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.]
(For visitors with little time) It would be better to spend your time elsewhere.
 Phnom Krom. It is a temple built on the top of a hill in the late 9th century, during the reign of Yasovarman, 12 km south of Siem Reap.
"The dark atmosphere of the temple and the view of the Tonle Sap Lake make the climb up the hill worth it."
(A) You can organize a profitable combination between a visit to the place and a boat trip to the lake.
[You need] the Angkor pass to access the temple, so don't forget your passport when you go to Tonle Sap.
 Even though Jerusalem is the capital and largest city of Israel, most other states and the United Nations do not recognize it as such.
[The legendary city in the Judean Mountains has an incredible history.]
 The three monotheistic religions, Judaism, Christianity and Islam, consider it holy land and it functions as spiritual, religious and cultural center.
..Jerusalem is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Israel.
 There are many historical, archaeological and cultural sites in Jerusalem, as well as vibrant and crowded shopping centers, bars and restaurants.
[In the case of citizens from Cuba, Ecuador requires that those citizens have a letter of invitation before entering the country through international airports or border posts.]
[This] letter must be legalized by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ecuador and meet certain requirements.
 The objective of these requirements is to provide an organized migratory flow between the two countries.
[Those] who come from Cuba and have a green card from the US must present themselves to an Ecuadorian consulate to be granted an exemption from this requirement.
[It is required that] the validity of your passport extends by at least 6 months after your travel dates. [It is also required that] you have a round-trip ticket, so that we can verify the length of your stay.
"Group tours are cheaper for larger groups, so if you're alone or with just one friend, try to meet people and form a group of four to six to get a better rate for each person."
 However, you shouldn't worry about this, as tourists often mix together to complete the vehicles.
"In truth, it seems to be more of a way to trick people into thinking they have to pay more."
"The mountain of Machu Picchu is located in the northern end of the ruins. It is frequently the background of many photographs of the ruins."
[From below] it looks a bit daunting, the climb has a steep gradient and is difficult, but most people with a reasonable level of fitness should be able to complete it in about 45 minutes.
[The] stone steps extend along almost the entire path and, in the steepest parts, steel cables offer a handrail.
 However, be prepared for a lack of air and be careful on the most pronounced parts, especially when they are wet, as they can become dangerous very quickly.
(In the upper part) there is a small cave that you have to pass through. It is quite low and narrow.
"Aboard a boat is the best way to see the places and the wild life of Galápagos, just like Charles Darwin did in 1835."
60+ cruise ships sail over the waters of Galapagos and their capacity varies from 8 to 100 passengers.
 Most people reserve their spot in advance, as the boats tend to fill up during the high season.
 Make sure the agent you book with has specialized knowledge of Galápagos and a wide variety of boats in that destination.
[This will] ensure that your personal preferences or limitations coincide with the boat that best suits you.
(until the 16th century) During the pre-Hispanic era, the northern part of Chile was Inca territory, while the Araucanians (mapuches) lived in the center and south of the country.
[The Mapuches] were also one of the last American tribes to be absorbed by the Spanish language, not completely, but after the independence of Chile.
[Although] Chile declared its independence in 1810 (during the Napoleonic Wars, Spain was without a central government for some years), the decisive victory against the Spaniards didn't happen until 1818.
[Republica] Dominicana is a country in the Caribbean that occupies the eastern half of the island of [La] Española, which shares with Haiti.
[In addition to its white sand beaches and mountain landscapes, the country hosts the oldest European city in America, which now forms part of Santo Domingo.]
 The first inhabitants of the island were the Taínos and the Caribs; the latter spoke the Arahuaca language, and had arrived on the island approximately 10,000 years ago.
(A few years after the arrival of the European explorers, the Spanish conquistadors reduced the Taíno population significantly.)
(According to Fray Bartolomé de las Casas, the colonists from Spain killed about 100,000 Taínos between 1492 and 1498.)
"Garden of the Union". This place was built as an atrium for a convent from the 17th century, which only remains of the Temple of St. Diego.
[Now it functions as the central plaza, where things happen both day and night.]
 The garden is surrounded by several restaurants and, in the evenings and at night, concerts are offered for free from the central plaza.
"The Kissing Alley": Two balconies separated by only 69 cm is the home of a romantic legend.
 Some children will tell a story in exchange for a small tip.
 Bowen Island is a popular day trip or weekend getaway that includes kayaking, hiking, shopping, restaurants, and more.
"In Howe Sound, exactly next to Vancouver, there is this authentic community that can be reached easily by water taxis departing from Granville Island, in the center of Vancouver."
 For those who enjoy outdoor activities, a trip along the Sea to Sky Highway is a must.
 Whistler, which is a 1.5 hour drive from Vancouver, is expensive but known for the 2010 Winter Olympics.
..
[Permits] must be reserved in advance. To spend the night in Sirena, you must have a permit.
 The only park with lodging is Sirena. Not so in La Leona, San Pedrillo and Los Patos, where only camping is offered, without food service.
(While) You can reserve parking spaces directly from the park station in Puerto Jiménez, you can't pay with a credit card.
[The National Parks Service (MINAE) does not issue permits more than one month in advance of the arrival date.]
"CafeNet El Sol" provides a reservation service for a fee of US$ 30 or $10 per day; more details, on the Corcovado page.
"The Cook Islands, in the South Pacific Ocean, are a self-governing state in association with New Zealand."
15 islands make up the Galapagos archipelago, which covers an oceanic area of 2.2 million km2.
 Because it shares the same time zone as Hawaii, sometimes these islands are called "Hawaii below the whole."
"While it's smaller, some visitors to the third age remember it as Hawaii, before it became a state and there were no big hotels and other tourist developments."
15 islands make up the Cook Islands, the most important of which are Rarotonga and Aitutaki.
"Today, providing luxury accommodation and breakfast has become, for countries of the first world, a form of art."
(In the best category) The competition between B&Bs is, of course, in two services: the bed linen and breakfast.
..in the most exclusive of these establishments, one may find the most luxurious bed linens, perhaps a handmade coverlet or an antique bed.
"For breakfast, you can serve seasonal delights from that region or the specialty of the host."
[The] scene could be composed of a historic building with antique furniture, immaculate gardens or a swimming pool.
"Getting in your own car and starting a long road trip has an inherent attraction in its simplicity."
[Unlike what happens with larger vehicles,] you are probably already familiar with the driving of your vehicle and are aware of its limitations.
"Raising a tent on private property or in a town without permission can attract unwanted attention."
"Synthesizing," it's a great option to take a road trip in your own car, but very few times will it serve as a way to "camp."
 Those who have a wide minivan, SUV, sedan or pickup truck with reclining seats can camp in their vehicle.
 Some hotels are owners of a legacy of the golden age of the steam train and the transatlantic liners, which date from before World War II, in the 19th century or the early 20th century.
 In these hotels, the rich and famous of the time enjoyed good meals and nightlife.
"Out of fashion" accessories, lack of the most up-to-date amenities, and a certain sophistication are also part of their charm.
.. although, in general, they are private property, they sometimes host state leaders and other visiting dignitaries.
 A very wealthy traveler could consider making a trip around the world, stopping at many of these hotels.
"A hospitality exchange network is an organization that connects travelers with residents of the destinations they will visit."
"Joining a network usually requires filling out an online form, although some networks may require additional verification."
[...], the list of hosts is provided, printed or online, sometimes with references and comments from other travelers.
"Couchsurfing" was founded in January 2004, after a programmer named Casey Fenton was able to get a low-cost flight to Iceland, but was unable to find a place to stay.
[He] wrote emails to students in the area and received a lot of offers of free lodging.
(Generally) Hostels are for young people (the average guest is in their twenties), but you can find older travelers.
"Families with children" are something that doesn't happen often, but some hostels will accept them in private rooms.
[Pekin] will be the first city to host both the summer and winter Olympics.
[Pekin] will be the host of the opening and closing ceremonies and the ice events that will be held under a roof.
[In the ski area located in Taizicheng, Zhangjiakou, which is about 220 km (140 mi) from Beijing, there will be other ski events.]
 Most temples celebrate an annual festival, which can start between November and May, depending on the temple's calendar.
 Most festivals in the temple are celebrated as part of the anniversary of the temple or the birthday of the deity in charge, or any other important event that relates to the temple.
[The] regular procession of decorated elephants, the temple orchestra and other festivities make the temple festivals of Kerala very seductive.
 A World's Fair (usually called an Exposition, or Expo) is an international festival of great scope where arts and sciences converge.
[The] countries that participate exhibit their artistic and educational displays in national pavilions, to illustrate global problems or the history and culture of the country.
 International horticultural events are specialized meetings where floral arrangements, botanical gardens and everything related to plants are exhibited.
(While theoretically they are supposed to be done once a year, in practice they are not.)
[These events] last from three to six months and are held on properties of at least 50 hectares.
35mm film is the most common format.
(In general) It can be easily replaced if it runs out of power and offers a similar resolution to the current DSLR.
56mm film is a medium format film that uses a 6x6cm frame.
35mm film has a resolution of 3136mm2, while 120 film has a resolution of 864mm2.
 One of the most challenging topics for photographers is wildlife, and they need a combination of good luck, patience, experience and good equipment.
 It is common that wildlife photography is not valued. However, as in most disciplines, a picture is worth a thousand words.
 For wildlife photography, a telephoto lens is usually required, but other lenses are needed for subjects like a flock of birds or a small creature.
(Many) exotic species are difficult to find and it is common for parks to restrict photography with commercial purposes.
 There are wild creatures timid and others aggressive. The environment can be of low temperatures, warm or hostile.
5,000 languages are spoken on Earth, with more than 20 spoken by more than 50 million people.
(In general) Written communication is easier to understand than spoken communication. A good example of this is directions, which are often difficult to pronounce so that they can be understood.
 A large number of countries speak English fluently and in many more you can expect to find some knowledge of the language, particularly among the younger generation.
 Imagine, for example, a mancunian, a bostonian, a jamaican and a sydneyite sitting at a table sharing a meal in a restaurant in Toronto.
 They delight in telling stories of their hometowns, with their different accents and local jargon.
(In general) The most economical way to eat is to buy food at the supermarket. However, if cooking is not possible, the options are reduced to pre-cooked foods.
[Supermarkets] receive a greater variety of prepared foods. Some even have microwaves or other means to heat up the food.
 In some countries or types of stores, there is at least one restaurant inside the place, which, generally, is quite informal and its prices, economical.
 Bring a copy of your policy and contact information for your insurance company.
 To obtain advice or make claims, you must show the email address of the insurer and their international phone numbers.
(Keep another copy in your luggage and a digital (send it as an attachment by email or upload it to the cloud).
 In case of traveling with a laptop or a tablet, save a copy on the memory or on the hard drive that you can access without Internet.
..also give copies of the policy and contact information to those traveling with you and to family or friends in your home country who are willing to help.
(Uapitíes) Elk (also called alces) are not aggressive, however, they will defend themselves if they feel threatened.
 If individuals do not perceive that elk are potentially aggressive, they may approach them too closely and put themselves in danger.
"Drink alcohol in moderation. This affects people differently and knowing your own limits is very important."

"In illegal alcoholic beverages, there can be many impurities that are dangerous, such as methanol, which can cause blindness or even death, even if only a small amount is consumed."
(In Spanish) Lenses can be cheaper in a foreign country, particularly in those with lower labor costs.
 Consider the option of having an eye exam in your home country, to see if it is covered by your insurance, and then take the prescription with you to any other destination in the world.
(1) The high-quality riding saddles that can be bought in that area may have two drawbacks: some may be imitations and the authentic ones may be more expensive than in the country of origin. (2) The high-quality riding saddles that can be bought in that area may have two drawbacks: some may be imitations and the authentic ones may be more expensive than in the country of origin.
"Coffee is one of the basic goods that is most traded in the world and you will find many varieties in your region of origin."
"However, there are many different ways to take coffee all over the world, which deserve to be tried."
"Barranquismo" is a term used to describe the act of going down a dry or full riverbed.
"Barranquismo" is a sport that combines elements of swimming, climbing and jumping. It requires relatively little training or physical fitness for those who start out in it (for example, compared to rock climbing, scuba diving or alpine skiing).
"Hiking" is a recreational activity that involves walking in natural environments, often on trails made for the purpose.
"Day walks" are walks that cover distances of less than a mile to longer walks that can be completed in a day.
 For a day hike on a simple trail, little preparation is needed and anyone in reasonable shape can do it.
[It is possible that families with young children may need more preparation, even with infants and toddlers, but it is easy to spend a day outdoors.]
200+ running tourism organizations operate independently around the world.
"Go! Running Tours, successor to Global Running Tours, connects dozens of running tour providers in four continents."
"Running Tours" is a running tour company that started in Barcelona, Spain, and then quickly joined by "Running Tours" in Prague, Czech Republic, and other cities.
 There are many things to consider before and during travel to any destination.
[When traveling], prepare yourself for things not to be like "at home". There will be differences in things like manners, laws, food, traffic, lodging, rules, language, and other things.
"It is important to keep in mind that there are always local ways of doing things, and that these may not be the same as the ones you are used to."
 Travel agencies have existed since the 19th century. Generally, a travel agent is a good option for cases in which the traveler does not have previous experience in matters such as nature, culture, language, or low-income countries.
 While many agencies are willing to take on almost any type of reservation, many agents specialize in certain types of trips, price ranges, or specific destinations.
"It's better to contact an agent who makes frequent reservations for trips similar to yours."
 Consult the travel agent. You can do it on a website as well as in the window of a travel agency.
 If you want to travel the world on a low budget, for necessity, lifestyle, or as a challenge, there are some ways to do it.
"Work while you travel" and "restrict expenses" are the two main categories of business travelers. This article focuses on the latter.
 Those who are willing to give up comfort, time and predictability in order to reduce costs to almost zero will find out by taking a minimum budget trip.
[The recommendation] implies that travelers do not steal, violate private property, participate in the illegal market, beg or in any other way exploit other people for their own benefit.
"Generally, an immigration checkpoint is the first stop after landing from a plane, boat, or other means of transportation."
(In certain border railroads, inspections are done inside the train while it is moving, so you must have a valid ID to board one of them.)
(In) Night trains, the conductor can collect passports to not interrupt their sleep.
[The] registration is an additional requirement for the visa process. In some countries, you will have to register your presence and the address of your accommodation with local authorities.
(This) could require you to fill out a form with the local police or to present yourself at the immigration office.
 In many countries where this law applies, the local hotels will take care of the registration (don't forget to check).
 In other cases, only those who are not staying in tourist accommodations need to register. However, this makes the law much more uncertain, so make sure to check beforehand.
(The) architecture of a site is often a tourist attraction in itself.
 Many buildings are really beautiful to look at, and the view from those with strategically placed windows or from high up can be a beautiful sight to behold.
[Architecture] has many points of contact with other disciplines, among which are urban planning, civil engineering, interior design, decorative arts, and landscape architecture.
(Because of the distance from many of the towns) you won't find much nightlife if you don't travel to Albuquerque or Santa Fe.
..but most casinos still serve alcohol and many of them offer shows of renown (principally the largest, located around Albuquerque and Santa Fe).
[Caution: the bars in the small towns in this area are not always a good option for the traveler coming from another country.]
[To begin,] the north of New Mexico has serious problems with drunk drivers and its concentration is high in the vicinity of the small bars in the city.
"Graffiti" is the term for the unwanted markings on a wall.
 Even though graffiti is not a modern phenomenon, most people tend to associate it with vandalism of public and private properties by young people using spray paint.
[However], there are artists of graffiti who are recognized today, there are graffiti events and there are legal walls. In this context, graffiti paintings can, often, look more like art than illegible tags.
 Many tourists want to learn how to throw a boomerang.
 If you want to learn how to throw a boomerang and have it return to your hand, make sure you have one that is suitable for returning.
"In truth, most of the bumbershoots available in Australia don't return to the place from which they were thrown. For novices, it's convenient not to try to throw them if it's windy."
"Hangi" is a traditional Maori dish that is prepared in a hole in the ground.
"The hole is heated by hot stones taken from the fire or, in some places, the geothermal heat makes certain areas of the ground heat up naturally."
"Hangi" is a traditional Maori cooking method used to prepare a meal with a traditional style of cooking.
 Some places in Rotorua have geothermal hangi, while others can be tried in Christchurch, Wellington, and others.
[Suburban] MetroRail has two types of suburban railways in Cape Town and surrounding areas: MetroPlus (also known as First Class) and Metro (Third Class).
 MetroPlus offers more comfort and less crowding, although it is a bit more expensive. However, it is still cheaper than regular metro tickets in Europe.
(1) Each Metro car has a MetroPlus car attached to it. (2) The MetroPlus car is always located at the end of the train closest to Cape Town.
"Never lose sight of your luggage, especially when crossing international borders."
[Could] find yourself being used as a carrier of psychotropic drugs without your knowledge, which will bring you many problems.
..and waiting in line, because at any moment, and without warning, the drug-detecting dogs can be used.
 Some countries impose excessively harsh punishments, including death sentences, for crimes committed for the first time.
"Loose luggage is a target for thieves and, at the same time, attracts the attention of authorities, who are alert for possible bomb threats."
[In his home country], he is almost certainly immune to the local germs.
[However], in other parts of the world where you are not familiar with the bacterial fauna, there are great chances of problems.
..and in warmer climates, bacteria develop faster and live longer outside the body.
"From there, the Delhi Belly flagellum, the curse of the Pharaoh and the Montezuma vendetta and their many friends."
..as well as with respiratory problems in colder climates, intestinal problems in warmer climates are quite common and, although certainly annoying, are not really dangerous.
 If this is your first trip to a developing country or to a place you've never been, don't underestimate the possible cultural impact.
[A] traveler who is stable and capable has been overwhelmed by the changes that come with traveling to developing countries, where many small cultural adjustments can accumulate quickly.
..especially during the first few days, consider the possibility of spending a good amount of money on hotels, food and services of good quality and western style.
"It is recommended not to sleep on a mattress or a mattress on the floor in areas where you are not familiar with local wildlife."
 If you're camping, bring a cot or hammock to keep the distance from snakes, scorpions, and the like.
"Fill your home with a delicious cup of coffee in the morning and a relaxing cup of manzanilla in the evening."
 When you are on vacation at home, you have the time to give yourself a treat and spend a few more minutes to cook a special dish.
 If you're feeling adventurous, take advantage of the opportunity to try some of the smoothies:
[Maybe] I'll find a drink for breakfast that's easy to make when I get back to my daily routine.
 If you live in a city with a diverse culture of drinks, visit bars or pubs in neighborhoods you don't usually go to.
"Infectious" and "contagious" are not the same thing.
"Infectious disease" is a disease caused by a pathogen, such as a virus, a bacterium, a fungus, or other organism.
"Contagious" is a term used to describe a disease that is easily transmitted by being in close proximity to someone who is infected.
[Many] countries require vaccinations for various diseases of travelers entering or residents leaving.
"Often, these requirements depend on the countries you have visited or intend to visit."
 One of the main advantages of Charlotte, North Carolina, is that it offers a good number of quality options for families.
"The good life" is often cited as the primary reason people move to the area, and visitors often find it easy to enjoy the city with children around.
20 years ago, Uptown Charlotte had a handful of options for children. Now, there are dozens.
"In Charlotte, it's not common for families to take taxis, but they can be useful in certain situations."
"Overload" is applied if there are more than two passengers, so this option could be more expensive than necessary.

(1) Tourism is expensive, (2) it requires good physical condition, (3) it can only be done in summer from November to February, and (4) it is mostly done in the peninsula, the islands and the Ross Sea.
2,000 employees live here in the summer, in about 40 bases, mostly in those regions, but only a small number stay during the winter.
[Antarctica is] a vast, ice-covered continent with a few scattered islands.
(Sometimes) specialized air excursions are made to practice mountaineering or to go to the Pole, where there is a large base.
1600 km of road from McMurdo to the South Pole.
"Compacted snow, with cracks filled and marked with flags. Only tractors can drive there, carrying sleds with fuel and other supplies."
 These are not very agile, so the road must make a long loop around the Transantarctic Mountains to reach the plateau.
 In winter, the most common cause of accidents is the road, the approach and, in particular, the slippery steps.
[It is essential] that you have at least some kind of shoes with appropriate soles. Summer shoes generally slip a lot on ice and snow, even winter boots are not always appropriate.
5mm (1/5 inch) or greater is the minimum depth for the pattern, and the material must be soft enough to work in cold temperatures.
 There are boots with spikes and there is an additional accessory with spikes for slippery conditions, which can be adapted to almost any shoe, both for heels and for the sole.
[It is necessary that the heels are low and wide. Often, sand, gravel or salt (calcium chloride) is spread on the roads or paths to obtain better adherence.]
 Avalanches are not abnormal; steep slopes only resist a certain amount of snow, so the excess will fall in the form of avalanches.
 The problem is that snow is sticky, which is why it requires some activation to fall, and that fall can be the trigger for the rest.
 Sometimes, the factor that triggers an avalanche is the sun that melts the snow, other times, it's a new snowfall or other natural events, and often, it's the human.
 A tornado is a rotating column of air that sucks air in and up around it.
 They produce great winds (frequently 100-200 miles/hour) and can lift heavy objects into the air, carrying them along with the tornado as it moves.
 They start as funnels that descend from storm clouds and transform into tornadoes when they touch the ground.
(redes privadas virtuales) personal providers are the ideal option to avoid political censorship and commercial IP geofiltering.
1. They are superior to proxy servers for several reasons: they redirect all Internet traffic and not only HTTP. 2. They are more secure than proxy servers. 3. They are more efficient than proxy servers. 4. They are more flexible than proxy servers. 5. They are more scalable than proxy servers. 6. They are more reliable than proxy servers. 7. They are more secure than proxy servers. 8. They are more efficient than proxy servers. 9. They are more flexible than proxy servers. 10. They are more scalable than proxy servers. 11. They are more reliable than proxy servers. 12. They are more secure than proxy servers. 13. They are more efficient
(Usually) provide better quality of service and more bandwidth. Encrypted and thus more difficult to hack.
"Communications companies lie repeatedly about their purpose, claiming that it's to 'prevent piracy'."
"In fact, region codes do not affect illegal copies in any way. A copy of a disc that is identical to the original will play without problems on the same devices as the original."
 The hidden objective of these companies is to gain more control over their markets; they are trying to make money circulate.
 Because calls are routed over the Internet, you don't need to use a local cell phone company where you live or where you are going.
..or you can use a satellite connection in the wilds of Chicken, Alaska, and choose a number that signals you're in sunny Arizona.
"Often, you have to buy a global number separately so that it can be called from PSTN phones. Where it comes from makes a difference for those who call it."
"Instantaneous translation" applications: those that can generate, automatically, complete translations of segments of text from one language to another.
 Among these applications, we can find some that translate the text of real-world signs and other objects into foreign languages if the user focuses their smartphone camera on such objects.
(Machine translation) The translation engines have improved drastically and now, frequently, provide quite correct translations (and rarely nonsense); however, it is necessary to have some caution, since it is still possible that they fail.
 One of the main applications in this category is Google Translate, which performs translation without a connection if the data for the language to be worked on is downloaded.
(Probably) The most convenient and easy way to navigate while outside of your country is to install GPS apps on your smartphone.
 You can save money by buying new maps for GPS, a separate GPS device, or renting one at any car rental agency.
 If you don't have a data connection for your phone or if you are out of range, your phone may not work or may have a reduced performance.
[In every corner of every street, there are] a huge and confusing variety of prepaid phone cards that can be used in public phones or common phones.
"Although most calling cards are good for calling anywhere, some offer favorable rates for calling specific countries."
(In general) You can access these services by calling a free number that can be used from most phones, without any cost.
"The rules of photography also apply to video recording, perhaps even more so."
"If you can't take a picture of something, then you shouldn't even think about filming it."
 If you use a drone, you need to check what can be filmed and what permits or extra licenses are needed.
 Even if it's legal in your region, it's probably not a good idea to fly a drone near an airport or over a crowd.
[Currently,] most air travel reservations are not made directly with the airline, but rather through a search and comparison of prices.
 Sometimes, the same flight can cost very different prices on different content aggregators, so it's worth comparing the search results and browsing the company's website before making the reservation.
 Even if you don't need a visa for short stays in certain destinations, as a tourist or for business, traveling to those same destinations as an international student generally involves a longer stay than a typical tourist visit.
(In general) To stay in any foreign country for a long period of time, you will need to get a visa in advance.
(For the most part) Student visas have different requirements and procedures for application than those for normal tourist or business visas.
 In most countries, you will need to provide a letter of intent from the institution where you intend to study and, in addition, prove that you have funds to support yourself for at least the first year of the course.
[Make] inquiries at the institution and at the immigration office of the destination where you want to study, in order to take detailed knowledge of the requirements.
(Unless you are a diplomat) Having a job abroad means you will have to declare your income in your country of residence.
 The tax on income is organized differently in different states and the tax rates and categories differ greatly between countries.
 There are states in the US and Canada where the federal and local tax rates are the same. As a result, the rates and categories can be different depending on the region.
"Although there is no formal immigration control, it is just a formality, when you arrive in your country of origin, customs control can be a hassle."
"Make sure you know what you can bring in and what you can't. Also, declare any goods that exceed the legal limits."
 The easiest way to start a business in the travel writing industry is to improve your skills on a travel blog website.
(After) becoming familiar with the format and editing in the web, you could be ready to design your own website.
 Volunteering while traveling is an extraordinary way to make a difference, but the goal is not just to give.
 Volunteering in a foreign country is a great way to learn about a different culture, meet new people, learn about yourself, gain a new perspective, and acquire new skills.
 It could also be a good way to stretch your budget and allow for a longer stay, as many volunteer jobs offer housing and food, and some pay a small stipend.
"The navigable waterways of Russia were used by the Vikings to reach the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea. It is still possible to use parts of these waterways. It is necessary to obtain special permits, which is a possibility, and it could be difficult to obtain."
 The Arctic Ocean is connected to the Baltic Sea through the White Sea-Baltic Sea Canal, via the lakes Onega and Ladoga and St. Petersburg, mostly via rivers and lakes.
 Thanks to the fact that Lake Onega also joins the Volga, it can be accessed from the Caspian Sea, passing through Russia.
 You can be sure that once you get to the port, everything will be pretty obvious. You will meet other hitchhikers who will share their information with you.
[His] task will be, basically, to put up signs offering his help, to walk the docks, to approach people who clean the yachts, to try to make contact with the sailors in the bar, etc.
 Try to talk to as many people as possible. After a while, everyone will know him and will give him information about the boat he is looking for.
[He] should carefully choose his frequent flyer alliance.
 Even though it might seem logical to join the airline with which you fly the most, you should know that the benefits offered by that airline may be different and that, sometimes, the points of the traveler can offer more benefits in another airline of the same alliance.
[Airlines] such as Emirates, Etihad, Qatar and Turkish Airlines have increased their flights to Africa and offer connections to many of the continent's major cities at a lower price than other European companies.
2014, Turkish Airlines has flights to 39 destinations in 30 countries in Africa.
 If you have time to spare during your trip, find out how your total fare compares to a fare for traveling around the world.
[Remember to include] additional costs, departure taxes, land transport, etc. for all places you visit outside of Africa.
 If you want to travel around the world circumnavigating the southern hemisphere, you will have fewer options for flights and destinations because there are fewer trans-oceanic routes.
(SkyTeam) No alliance covers the South Hemisphere (and SkyTeam doesn't cover any of them).
[However], Star Alliance covers everything except for the eastern portion of the Pacific Ocean, which extends from Santiago, Chile to Tahiti, which corresponds to the flights of LATAM Oneworld.
 If you want to avoid the Pacific South and the western limit of South America, there are other options besides this flight (see below).
1994, the Nagorno-Karabaj region, an ethnic Armenian region in Azerbaijan, launched a war against the Azeris.
[With the support of] Armenia, a new republic was formed, although it is not an established nation. It does not even have the official recognition of the Armenian government.
[The] ties between Armenia and Azerbaijan continue to be affected by the differences in diplomatic nature that revolve around this region.
"The Canal District" in Amsterdam, the popular neighborhood around the city center.
[The entire district] was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO, due to its unique historical and cultural value, and its property prices are among the highest in the country.
"Five Lands" is the name of the five small towns that make up the Cinque Terre region in Liguria, Italy.
 They are part of the UNESCO World Heritage List.
(With the passage of time,) people have built carefully constructed platforms on irregular and steep landscapes, even on cliffs overlooking the sea.
..its charm is in part due to the lack of corporate development. There are roads, trains and boats that connect the villages and vehicles can't access from the outside.
 There are subtle differences between the French spoken in Belgium and Switzerland and the French spoken in France; however, their similarity is such that they are mutually intelligible.
[...], the Belgian and Swiss French systems have slight differences from the French spoken in France and the pronunciation of some words is subtly different.
[However], all Belgians and Swiss French speakers will have learned standard French in school, so they could understand me, even if I spoke to them using the French system of numeration.
"Hello" is a friendly greeting in many places around the world.
"Come here" is a common phrase in Malaysia, but it's used differently in rural areas. It's a gesture that's used in some Western countries, but it should only be used in that context.
[A] traveler from Britain who visits Spain might confuse a gesture of farewell that consists of turning the palm of the hand toward the person being saluted (before the person being saluted) as a gesture to return.
"Auxiliary languages" are artificial or constructed languages created to facilitate communication between peoples who would otherwise have difficulty communicating.
"Lenguas vehiculares" are languages that are used to communicate between speakers of other languages.
(During the daytime) During the heat of the day, it is possible that tourists may see mirages that create the illusion of seeing water, among others.
"These can be dangerous if the traveler follows the mirage, which will cause them to waste valuable energy and the remaining water."
 Even the hottest deserts can become dramatically cold at night. If you don't have warm clothing, you are at risk of suffering from hypothermia.
 If you decide to go for a walk in the tropical jungle, you should be careful of the mosquitoes, especially during the summer.
 Even if you're driving through the tropical rainforest and open the doors for just a few seconds to get into the vehicle, that's enough for the mosquitoes to climb in with you.
"Avian influenza" is the term used for the flu that affects birds and mammals.
 Even though there have been less than 1000 cases in people, some of these have had fatal outcomes.
"While most of the people affected had contact with poultry, there is also a risk for bird watchers."
[Norway] is typical of fiords and valleys with steep slopes that suddenly open up to a flat plain.
"Vidde" is the term used to describe these large, open spaces without trees, which means "open space" or "unlimited space."
"Hei" is a common name for the heathlands of Rogaland and Agder, which are usually covered with heather.
[Glaciers] are not immobile, but they flow down mountains, which can cause cracks or crevasses that could be hidden by snow bridges.
[They] could collapse the walls and roofs of ice caves, and close the cracks.
[Blocks] fall off the edges of glaciers and sometimes roll or jump far from the edge.
(In) In the mountain stations of India, the high season for tourists, usually peaks during the summer.
..but its beauty and charm in winter are special, with a great number of ski resorts where snow falls in large amounts, making it possible to practice sports like skiing and snowboarding.
"Funeral airlines" that still offer fares by duel are very few and discount them only slightly.
[The airlines that offer them are] Air Canada, Delta Air Lines, Lufthansa, for flights that begin in the U.S. or Canada, and WestJet.
 In all cases, you have to make the reservation by phone and directly with the airline.
