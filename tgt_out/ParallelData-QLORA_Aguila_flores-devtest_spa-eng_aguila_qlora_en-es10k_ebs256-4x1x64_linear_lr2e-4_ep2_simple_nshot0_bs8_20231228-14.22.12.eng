The day before, Martelly took office as interim President of Haiti.
In four years, it is the fifth CEP of Martelly.
A presidential commission advised that the CEP resign, in the context of a series of measures aimed at leading to new elections.
The Commission was the way Martelly responded to the generalized protests that began in October.
The protests, in some cases violent, were sparked by the lack of elections, in some cases since 2011.

Experts from the Princeton University and Uppsala University, in the U.S., and from the University of Princeton and the University of Uppsala, in Sweden, reported that the new species evolved in two generations, even though it was thought to take a long time, due to breeding between a Darwin's finch, Geospiza forts, and a cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
The gold can take many forms and bear many names.
It is also possible to bend and twist the wire into a very thin thread, and then twist it into a spiral.
It can be very thin and adhere to another metal. It is possible to make thinner and slimmer than before, and it is used to decorate illuminated manuscripts.
This is called the pH of a chemical substance.
The color of the juice of cabbage will be altered in accordance with the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical substance.
The number of hydrogen ions in the sample determines the pH of the sample.
Hydrogen atoms are formed by a proton and an electron. As a result, a hydrogen ion is the result of removing a proton from a hydrogen atom.

When one communicates with someone who is miles away, he is using a satellite.
The satellite receives the signal and returns it almost instantaneously.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. The scientists use telescopes in space, as the atmosphere of the Earth distorts part of the light and view we see.
A giant rocket is needed to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in amazing ways. It has made travel much more convenient and faster.
Thanks to her we have many different means of transportation, such as the railroad or the car, among others.
Below, there are medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey, such as rabbits, hares, and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats that feed on small prey, including domestic cats, which are more numerous than previously thought, and include insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of niche: each cat has a particular function, which prevents it from competing with other cats.
Lions are the most social animals and their lives are spent in large groups.
Groups are formed by one to three males of the same family, joined by up to thirty females and their young.
Female elephants are usually closely related, and they form a family.
Leopard manades have the same behavior as wolves or dogs, with whom they share a surprising resemblance (in contrast to the other great felines) in their behavior and lethality for their prey.
The tiger is an integral athlete, but he doesn't have the strength of a muscular man, nor the agility of a muscular man.
The tiger is of the same genus (Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These are the only four cats that can roar.
The tiger is not a roar, but a whisper, a sigh, a murmuring.
Ocelotes enjoy feeding on small animals. In as far as possible, they will hunt for small rodents, snakes, and birds. Most of their prey will be smaller than themselves.
Scientists believe that otters track down prey by smelling out the ground where they have been seen.
They have very good night vision and in dark places and they can also move very quietly. They hunt by ambush and then they ambush their prey.
When a small group of animals (a small population) strays from the main population of which they are descended (for example, if they move to a mountain range or to a river, or if they move to a new island and cannot easily return) they will often find themselves in a different environment from that to which they were accustomed.
The new environment will have different resources and competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor.
No major changes have been made to the original population, which still requires the same adaptations that were applied in the past.
Over time, as the new population becomes more accustomed to the new environment, it begins to resemble the other population.
Finally, after millions of years, the two populations will be so different that they will not be able to be classified as the same species.
Species speciating is simply the development of new species, and is a fundamental part of evolution.
Plants generate oxygen, which people breathe and absorb carbon dioxide (CO2) that plants exhale.
Plants use solar energy to generate food.
We build our houses from the plants and with them we also we make clothes. Most of the food we eat is plants. If we don't eat them, the animals wouldn't survive.
The Mosasaur was the dominant predator of its time, so it did not fear anyone else.
His jaws were long and sharp, and they were covered with a row of sharp teeth on the jaw, and another row on the palate, which translates to that anything that came in front of him, he could not escape.
We don't have the certainty, but we could have had the viperine.
He also attacked any creature that entered the water: even a T. Rex was a threat to him.
The Romans ate a lot of different kinds of food at their banquets, including pigs, deer, rats, and even a type of rodent, the lynx.
Another difference was that the poor ate while sitting down, while the rich ate while standing up.
It is impossible that the ancient Romans would have included foods from the New World or Asia centuries ago.
The Romans did not have maize, tomatoes, potatoes, or peanuts, and no Roman ever ate a turkey.
The Babylonians built temples for their gods, each of which was considered their home.

The Scandinavian countries were each distinct, but there were marked differences in relation to the people, the kings, the customs and the history of each country.
If you have seen the film "Treasure Island", you may think that a map of the treasure was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, the reverse of the document does contain something written, but it is not a map of a treasure.
The Declaration of Independence has written on its reverse the phrase «Declaration of Independence of 4 July 1776». The text is written in the lower left corner.
Although it is unknown who wrote it, it is known that it was only completed, and only a few pages long, when it was folded to be kept.
The following is a list of the most common English words and phrases used in the text.
The landings at Normandy, as well as the subsequent fighting, had liberated the north of France.

In less than two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were heading for Germany.
A civilization is a culture specifically defined by a group of people who live and work together.
The term civilization derives from the Latin civilis, which means civil, and is related to the word civis, from the same language, which means citizen, as well as civitas, which means city or city state and determines the size of society.
Cities are the precursors of nations. A civilization is a culture of knowledge, a long-term transmission of knowledge, and a homogeneous cultural heritage.
Minority cultures tend to disappear without leaving any historical traces, and they are not recognized as civilizations proper.
During the War of Independence, the Thirteen Colonies formed a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation, which was the only component of the Congress.
The Congress did not have the power to impose taxes and, because of the existence of a national executive or judicial power, the power to enforce all its laws often did not bear fruit.
It was not authorized to annul any fiscal or tariffs between states.
The articles demanded unanimous approval of all the states to amend the constitution and the states gave little importance to the central government's representatives.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national team, is the second most successful team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.

Skiing and snowboarding are popular in the northern regions, with athletes participating in international and Olympic events.
There are about 7,000 islands in Japan, the largest being Honshu, which is the 7th largest island in the world.
Because of the conglomerate/group of islands, it is often referred to as an archipelago, from a geographical perspective.
The history of Taiwan dates from the 15th century, when European sailors recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, which means 'beautiful island'.
The establishment, in 1624, by the Dutch East India Company of a base in the southwestern Taiwan, gave rise to a transformation in the aboriginal method of production of grains, with the use of Chinese labor to work in the plantations of rice and sugar.
The Qing army took control of the western and northern coasts of Taiwan in 1683 and declared it a Qing province in 1885.
In 1895, after being defeated during the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government acceded to the Shimonoseki Treaty, through which it ceded Taiwan to Japan, who retained its control of the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is home to three capital buildings: Intihuatana, the Sun Temple and the Three Windows Temple.
The restoration of the buildings in the two ends of the complex has been completed.
By 1976, the restoration of Machu Picchu had reached 30% and work continues today.
For example, the most common format for still photography is 35mm film, which was the most widely used format in the era of film.
Today, the scanning technology is still being developed, but the most important dimension is the scale of the image sensor.
The 35 mm format is confusing, as its dimensions are 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
This is why the dimensional relationship of this format is said to be 3:2.
Many typical formats (for example, the APS group of formats) are very similar to this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, which has been subject to many jokes and many times ridiculed, is a simple rule that generates dynamism and at the same time allows for some order to the images.
It indicates that the most effective position for placing the central object is the intersection of horizontal and vertical lines that divide the image into three equal sections (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had accumulated wealth and power, was challenged.
For more than a thousand years Christianity had united the states of Europe, even though their languages and customs were different.
His power was present everywhere, from the king to the common man.
One of the most important principles of Christianity is that wealth ought to be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that church funds are reserved for that specific purpose.
The central dome of the church had been in Rome for more than a thousand years and this concentration of power and money had led to questions as to whether this principle was being respected.
The British blockade of Germany began shortly after the outbreak of war.
The strategy, which involved the interruption of vital military and civilian supplies, was successful, but it violated the general international law and the provisions of many international agreements of the last two centuries.
The United Kingdom seized international waters in sections to block the entry of ships, even if they were neutral.
Germany was to be confronted with a reduced response to its submarine warfare.

In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job with Edison in New York.
He arrived in the U.S. with four cents, a book of poems and a recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his last manager) and addressed to Thomas Edison.
China had a unique way of dividing time into distinct periods.
Between each dynasty, there was also a period of instability, with provinces divided. The most famous was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted 60 years, from the Hán to the Jìn dynasties.
During these stages, a bloody civil war broke out between many nobles who were vying for the throne.
One of the most bloody periods in the history of ancient China was the Three Kingdoms, where thousands of people died in a struggle for the throne of the great palace in Xi'an.
Many of its consequences are political and social, such as the use of the metric system, the replacement of absolutism with republicanism, the conviction that the country belongs to the people, and not to a single sovereign.
The following year, the first women were admitted to the bar.
The same applies to the military, as they now base their charges on calibre.
The French Revolution was also a source of inspiration for many other oppressed classes in other countries to take up their own revolutions.
Mahoma was deeply interested in matters beyond this worldly life. He visited a cave that was known as Hira in the mountain of Noor (light) to reflect.
The cave itself, which endured for a long time, illustrates the spiritual inclinations of Muhammad.
On the peak of the mountain to the north of Mecca, there is a cave completely isolated from the rest of the planet.
It is difficult to find, even if one is certain of its existence.
Nothing can be seen but the clear and the beautiful sky and the many mountains of the surrounding countryside.
Of the Seven Wonders, the only one still standing is the Great Pyramid of Giza.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptian people in the third century BC, is one of many pyramids and pyramid-like structures built to honor the deceased pharaoh.
The Great Pyramid of Giza, or the Valley of the Dead, in Egypt, contains numerous pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honour of the Pharaoh Khufu, and many other pyramids and temples were built in honour of his wives and family.
The arrowhead mark looks like an arrowhead, and the arrowhead mark looks like an arrowhead.
Up means to start at the tip of the arrow and push the bow, and down means to start at the end of the arrow and pull the bow.
The ascending arc creates a softer sound, while the descending arc is more forceful and taut.
Be free to use your own marks, but please remember that the marks on the bow are printed for musical purposes and should be respected.
On 6 October 1789, a mob of women from the market forced the terrified king Louis XVI, his two small children (Maria Teresa, eleven, and Louis Charles, four) and the sister of the king, Madame Elizabeth, to return to Paris from Versailles.

The crowd forced the king and queen to open the carriage windows.
In a certain moment, a rebel leader strode up to a royal executioner and stroked his head.
The Filipino people paid for the war expenses of the United States imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States with the purpose of paying the majority of the interest and principal on the government bonds that floated in the name of the Philippine government in Wall Street banks.
The profits from the long-term exploitation of the Philippines would be the principal gains of the American imperialism.
To understand the Templar Order, it is necessary to understand the context in which it was formed.
The historical period in which these events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, between the 10th and 13th centuries (i.e., between the years 1000 and 1300).
The Early Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages.
The deterministic technology concept comprises a range of ideas, from the impetus or imperative technology to a strict sense of the existence of a logic underlying the fate of mankind and how it is manifested in technology.
Most interpretation of technological determinism have two general ideas: that technology develops on its own course, independent of any cultural or political influence, and that technology has social effects which are inherent and not socially conditioned.
One could argue that the existence of cars inevitably leads to the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not feasible for a small number of vehicles, so new techniques are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The use of cars also leads to a higher rate of traffic accidents, which leads to the development of new techniques in the field of health care to repair damaged bodies.
The element of determinism was very present in Romanticism, as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the Romantic era, the geography shaped people and, with time, developed customs and cultures that were preferred to laws that were imposed arbitrarily.
As Paris is known as the fashion capital of Europe today, Constantinople was considered to be the fashion capital of the medieval world.
His fame as a center of luxury began around 400 BC and lasted until approximately 1100 AD.
During the 12th century, its status declined, mainly because of the return of the Crusaders, who brought gifts, such as silk and spices, which were valued more than the goods offered in the markets of the Byzantine Empire.
The title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The pinnacle of Gothic style was reached in the period between the 10th and 13th centuries.
The clothing of the early Byzantine Empire was influenced by the culture of the East.
However, due to the slow communication channels, styles of communication could be delayed by up to 25 to 30 years.
In the late Middle Ages, Europe developed its own distinctive style. One of the most significant developments of that time was that people began to use buttons to fasten their clothes.
The term subsistence farming is defined as agriculture that produces enough food for the farmers and their families to meet their own needs.
The subsistence farming is a simple practice, which generally uses seed stock originating from the region, and other simple methods to maximize production.
Historically, most farmers' main activity was subsistence farming, which is still practised in many developing countries.
Subcultures gather individuals with similar ideas and feelings of social marginalization and the ability to create a sense of identity.
There are many factors that can distinguish subcultures: age, ethnicity, class, location or gender of its members.
Characteristics that distinguish a subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, sexual, geographical, or political, or a combination of factors.
It is common for members of a subculture to exhibit subculture-specific features by using distinctive style, gestures and jargon.
One of the most commonly used ways to graph the importance of socialization is to analyze the few and tragic instances of children who were neglected, abused or intentionally neglected by adults during their childhood.
These children are called 'wild'. Some children are confined by people, in general their parents. In some cases, the abandonment of a child is due to the rejection of the child's severe physical or intellectual disability.
It is possible that children who have been abused or traumatized may have suffered from childhood abuse or childhood trauma.
It is said that some were raised by animals and some have lived on their own in the wild.
When the wild child is raised exclusively by animals other than humans, he exhibits behaviors (in his physical capabilities) that are almost identical to that of the specific animal that raised him, and his indifference to people.
Although the project-based learning approach should facilitate the learning process and make it more interesting, the andamiage goes a bit further.
The toolbox is not an educational technique; it is rather a support that provides assistance to those who are new to a new programme or new project.
The andamiage can be either real or virtual; to say it in other words, a teacher is a kind of andamio, but also is the small white paper clip on Microsoft Office.
Virtual andamiages are incorporated into the software and their function is to question, explain, or illustrate procedures that may have been complex for the student alone.
Children are placed in homes for a variety of reasons, from neglect to abuse and, even, extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment where he or she has never been cared for, cared for, and educated; but it does.
We can perceive that the family-based foster care system provides a safe environment for these children.
Our aim is to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, healthy education and medical care.
The aim of family care is to cover all the needs that were not being met in the child's former home.
Internet brings together mass communication and between people.
The different features of the Internet open up new dimensions from the perspective of the concept of rewards and rewards.
For example, the learning and socialization of Internet use are identified as significant incentives for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
During a study of user reactions to web sites conducted by Eighmey and McCord (1998), the motivational factors of personal participation and long-term relationships were also identified.
Through the recording of videos, important discoveries have been made in the interpretation of microexpressions, which are facial movements that are only a few milliseconds long.
The study of microexpression is a relatively new field of study.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, explained the way in which those who cannot understand speech due to a brain injury can, however, accurately evaluate sincerity.
Even suggests that human abilities to interpret human behavior can be shared with domestic animals.
The results of genetic studies of the twentieth century have shown two types of genetic variation: the hidden and the manifest.
The mutation process incorporates a new genetic variation; the selection removes that variation.
Segregation and recombination are the basis of variation between generations.
In the savanna, it is difficult for a primate, whose digestive system is like that of the human, to satisfy its amino acid requirements from the plant resources at hand.
It is more, it does not do it.
The protein sources in leaves and legumes would have been the most accessible source of plant protein for early hominids, but they are not easily digestible for primates like us, except that they are cooked.
The animal-derived foods (ant, termite, eggs) are easy to digest and contain a high amount of protein that contains all the essential amino acids.
In other words, it should not be surprising if our own predecessors solved their protein problems in the same way as the chimpanzees of the savanna today.
Sleep interruption is the deliberate awakening from sleep during the normal sleep period and falling asleep again after a short time.
It can be achieved easily by using a mild alarm clock that does not wake him up completely.
Registration is a requirement for the visa process. In some countries, you will need to register your presence and add your address with local authorities.
Other options that rely on the biological rhythm consist of drinking plenty of liquid (especially water or tea, known as a diuretic) before bedtime, which will force him to urinate in the morning.
The level of peace in a person is directly related to the amount of tension in their body and spirit.
As the lower the tension, the more positive is the life force with which we are blessed. Each of us has the potential to find absolute peace and happiness.
We can all reach enlightenment. Only we need to overcome our negativity and tension.
The basis of Tibetan Buddhism is the teachings of Buddha, and the Mahayana and Yoga traditions of India.
In general, laísmo is very easy. It is based on kundalini yoga, meditation and the love path.
In Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (enlightenment) is stimulated by yoga postures, meditation, mantras or visualization.
Tibetan meditation focuses on the Devata Yoga. Through visualizing deities, the energy channels can be cleared, the chakras can be activated and the awakening of enlightenment can be developed.
The Soviet Union and the United States cooperated in the war against Germany during World War II. The war ended with the defeat of Germany, and the two countries began to disagree on the future of Europe.
Two years after the end of the war, the allies were enemies and the Cold War began.
The war would be extended for 40 years and would be fought through a series of substitute militias, from Africa to Asia, through Cuba, and many other places.
Because the Polish defence was already broken up, the only hope was to retreat and reorganise in the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans fell into disuse almost overnight, when more than 800 000 Red Army soldiers from the Soviet Union invaded and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Treaty of Riga, the Non-Aggression Pact, the Polish-Soviet Pact and other international agreements, bilateral and multilateral.
Use ships to transport goods and people across the oceans.
The Navy has always been tasked with ensuring that its country retains the right to carry out its own shipping and trade activities, while also interfering with the ability of the enemy to do the same.
The North Atlantic campaign in World War II is one of the most dramatic examples of the use of the Atlantic Ocean as a transportation route.
The German navy, on the other hand, was also trying to blockade the British supply lines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany could have taken control of Britain, as they did with the rest of Europe.
The goats were domesticated, for the first time, about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains, in Iran.
To obtain milk, meat, and leather, the ancient peoples of the Americas used to take it from the mammals.
The domestic goat was usually kept in herds that wandered through the hills or other grazing areas, with care provided by children or adolescent shepherds. These methods of grazing are still in use today.
In England, railways had been installed by the mid-16th century.
Although the rails of the wagons were made of simple planks of wood, they allowed horses to pull them faster and carry heavier loads than on the rough roads.
The introduction of railroad ties to keep the rails in place was early. As a result, they gradually realized that railroad ties would be more effective if they were coated with iron on their top.
It was a practice to use the iron railroad rails as a means of transporting the coal.
The wheels were eventually replaced with iron wheels and, in 1767, iron wheels were introduced.
The first form of transport known was walking. The human race began to walk two million years ago with the appearance of the Homo Erectus (which means man upright).
The predecessors of the Australopithecidae, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright.
Evidence of bipedalism has been found in fossils of Australopithecines from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, but it is possible that the Sahelanthropus has walked on two legs for 7 million years.
We can begin to live more sustainably, join environmental movements, or even become environmental activists and fight to lessen the suffering of future generations.
It is, in many cases, as in the case of asymptomatic treatment, but if only a temporary situation is being addressed, we should find the root of the problems and try to undo them.
The world has undergone great changes, as a result of the advancements in science and technology and the problems have intensified because of the overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyles of people.
The draft was written by hand and signed by the president of the Congress, John Hancock, and the secretary, Charles Thomson, and sent to the printer John Dunlap, a few yards away.
The first of these was the "Dunlap copy", which was made in the early part of the 19th century.
John Nixon read the document and read it in the Independence Hall's patio on July 8.
The 6th of July, a copy of the Declaration was sent to George Washington, who ordered that it be read to his army in New York on 9 July.
The 25 photographs of Dunlap, which are known to exist, are the oldest known copies of the document.
A large number of paleontologists believe that a dinosaur species survived and is still alive today.
Many people don't see them as dinosaurs, since they have feathers and can fly.
However, there are still many features in birds that still resemble dinosaurs.
They have scaled legs and clawed hands, and lay eggs and move on their hind legs.
Today, almost all computers work by manipulating binary data.
A binary number can only have two values, they are the 0 and 1 and, according to the computer jargon, these numbers are known as binary digits, or bits.
Intoxicación interna may not be apparent at first. Its symptoms, such as vomiting, are too common to be diagnosed immediately.
The most clear indication of internal poisoning is to find a bottle of poisoned medicine or cleaning chemicals open.
Read the label for specific information on first aid information for that specific poison.
The entomologists use the term parasitic insect in a formal sense to refer to this group of arthropods.
The word is derived from its former association with the bed bug, a species that is highly developed for parasitizing humans.
Nest-dwelling and bed bugs are nidicolous; they are adapted to live in the nest or bed of their host.
The number of cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the United States is around 400 000, making it the most common neurological disease among adults aged 20 to 45.
The central nervous system, including the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve, is the target of attack in multiple sclerosis.
Women are twice as likely to have MS than men.
A couple might conclude that raising a child would not be the most convenient thing to do for them or for the child.
These couples could choose to adopt a baby.
In an adoption, biological parents give up their parental rights to a different couple so that they can be made legal guardians of the child.
The primary objective of science is to discover the way in which the world works through the scientific method.
It is not an experiment, but a test, it is a test that is used to exclude one or more possible hypotheses, making questions and observations that guide scientific research.
The focus of naturalists and philosophers was on the classics; especially, on the Latin version of the Bible.
The thought of Aristotle, especially the issues of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As the Greek language declined, Western society distanced itself from its Greek roots both philosophical and scientifically.
Many rhythms present in biological and behavioral processes depend on the internal clocks and their production through biological watches.
Periodic rhythms, which are not just reactions to regular external stimuli, have been recorded in almost all living things, even in bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
The biological clocks oscillate in a stable and self-sustaining manner and have a free-running period, even if there are no external stimuli.
One of the key indicators of the genetic nature of the DNA was the experiment conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase inserted their own DNA into a bacterial virus.
Two experiments were performed in which they marked DNA with radioactive phosphorus or with radioactive protein.
Based on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected genetic material and whether it involves sperm or germinal cells, the mutation can have various effects.
Only germline mutations can be passed on to children, while mutations in other parts of the body can cause cell death or cancer.
Tourism based on nature attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the wildlife and plant life.
Some examples of activities in the area are: hunting, fishing, birdwatching and visiting parks, and studying the ecosystem information.
An example is visiting, taking photographs and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Each morning, people leave small villages in their cars to go to work and often meet other people whose jobs are in the place from which they have just left.
This dynamic shuttle is based on the use of private cars, and they support it.
Currently, scientists say that the massive carbon economy has stripped the earth of one of its regular states that has contributed to the evolution of humanity for the last two million years.
All are part of society and use public transport systems; and most complain about them.
In developed countries, complaints about water quality or bridge collapses are rare.
What is the reason for such a high rate of complaints and why are there so many failures daily? Are engineers of transport simply incapable? Or is something more substantial happening?
Traffic flow is the study of traffic flow between two points and the interactions between vehicles.
It is difficult to study traffic flow, as it is not possible to make exact predictions about driver behaviour.
There is a trend in drivers to maintain a relatively consistent behaviour, which allows traffic flows to be consistent and can be represented mathematically.
To make the flow of circulation more clearly, relationships were established between the three most important elements: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
The following are the main objectives of the road safety programme: 
The first birds to fly were insects. This helped them evade their enemies more effectively and find food and a mate more easily.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to bend their wings backwards, so that they can fold them over their bodies.
This gives them a wider range of possible hiding places from predators.
The anisopterans and efemeropterans are the only insects that can not fold their wings.
In the past, a man called Aristotle said that the Solar System revolved around the Sun.
There were those who shared his theory, but many others believed that the Solar System orbited the Earth, even the Sun and other stars.
It seems to me that this is a good point of view, but I don't think so.
The Amazon River is the largest river in the world and the second largest river in the planet.
The Amazon is the widest river on Earth, with some sections reaching six miles in width.
Of the total water flowing into the oceans, 20% of it comes from the Amazon River.
The Amazon River has a length of 6,387 kilometres (3,980 miles) and receives water from many smaller rivers.
The pyramids of stone continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, never surpassing the pyramids of Guiza in size or in the sublime technique of their construction.

With approximately 800 inhabitants, the Vatican City is the world's smallest independent country and the country with the lowest population density.
Italian is used in the Vatican, both for drafting its legislation and for issuing its official communiqués.
The language spoken daily by most people working within the state is also Italian and Latin is generally used in religious ceremonies.
All Catholics in Vatican City adhere to the Roman Catholic faith.
The basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper are known since antiquity, as they can be found in nature in their original form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
Aristotle developed the theory that everything is composed of four elements: earth, water, air and fire.
It guarded greater similarity with the matter (with the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, but at the same time, it had the theory that they transform into new substances that form the things we see.
Alloys are, essentially, a combination of two or more metals.
Metals are elements such as calcium and potassium.
It is also possible that there are small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon, that are not metals.
All in the Universe is made of matter, composed of atoms.
The size of atoms is so minute that the end of this sentence could contain a trillion of them.
So, when the pencil was invented, the pencil became a friend of many.
However, the use of the pencil has declined and it has lost its status.
Today, people write messages on computers. They don't need a pencil to do it.
Only one thing is certain: the keyboard will be replaced by something else.
The nuclear bomb operates on the principle that it requires energy to form a nuclear core with a large number of protons and neutrons.
It is similar to what happens when a heavy truck rolls up a hill.  &apos;s core is split in two, releasing some of the energy.
Some atoms' nuclei are unstable, i.e. they tend to decay with little or no external stimulus.
The Moon is composed of rocks and dust and its outer layer is called the crust.
The outermost layer of the mantle is about 70 km thick at the near side and 100 km at the far side.
It is thinner under the moonlight and thicker under the high mountains.
It is possible that there are more oceans on the near side because of its thinner crust, which made it easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Theories of content focus on what attracts or interests people.
These doctrines hold that people have certain needs or desires that have been internalized as they matured.
These theories analyze what causes people to want things they want and what factors in their environment force them to want things they want.
Two theories of very well known are the hierarchy of needs theory, by Maslow, and the two-factor theory, by Hertzberg.
In general, there are two types of behaviour when managers begin to lead their former colleagues. On the one hand, there is the attempt to continue to be one of the boys (or girls).
To managers of this category it is difficult to take decisions that fall badly on employees, impose disciplinary measures, assign responsibilities and demand accountability from employees.
In the other end of the spectrum, it becomes a person who believes that everything he has done is wrong and needs to be changed.
At the end of the day, the ultimate responsibility for the team's success and failure is the team leader.
This tendency to isolate oneself from others is often a source of tension in a team.
The same standards of excellence that manage conventional computers apply to virtual machines, although there are minor differences.
The team members often operate as a point of contact for their physical group.
Generally, they enjoy greater autonomy than traditional group members, because their teams can meet in different time zones that, for example, might not be understood by the local management.
The existence of an invisible team (Larson and LaFasto, 1989 p. 109) is also a unique feature of virtual teams.
The invisible team is the management team, which reports to each member.
What motive could an organization have to undertake an organizational learning process? One of the purposes of applying the theories of organizational learning is to stimulate innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively in the operational departments of an organization, creativity and imagination can flourish.
Product of this process, it is possible that the process of an organization working in a team to overcome a challenge to develop a new process to address the needs of customers.
To be innovative, an organization must first create an innovation culture, as well as a shared vision and an organizational learning and knowledge sharing culture.
Angel (2006) describes the continuous improvement approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher performance.
The neurobiological data offer evidence for a theoretical approach to cognition research. Reduction of the field of research and greater accuracy result.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavioral research is a source of research.
Since long it has been known that several types of brain damage, trauma, injuries and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in mental functions.
Thanks to the advancement of new technologies, we have the opportunity to see and investigate structures and processes that have never been seen before.
This provides us with ample information and material for developing simulation models, which enables us to gain a better understanding of the mental processes.
Although it is often associated with science fiction, AI is a specialty within computer science, which is responsible for the intelligence, learning and adaptation in a computer.
Research in the field of artificial intelligence is the development of machines that can perform tasks that require intelligent behaviour.
Examples of this include monitoring, planning and programming, the ability to respond to customer inquiries, and facial recognition and voice recognition.
These issues are becoming separate disciplines, focused on solving real-life problems.
The artificial intelligence system is now used in many sectors of the economy, medicine, engineering and military, as well as in various computer games and personal computers.
Students are often taken on study trips.
The solution comes from technology, through virtual tours. The students can observe exhibits in a museum, visit a zoo, or view beautiful artworks while sitting with their class.
A virtual excursion can also be a good way to share an excursion with future students.
For example, every year, the students of Bennet High School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital and every year the website is updated, but the previous versions are preserved online.
Blogs can also improve the writing skills of students. Even though students often start with a poorly written grammar and spelling, this generally changes in the presence of an audience.
Because students are the most frequent critics, the writer of blog posts begins to improve his/her writing to avoid criticism.
The blogueo also requires students to be more empathetic to the world around them.
Blogs are a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to deepen their learning beyond the typical school day.
The appropriate use of blogs can empower students to be more analytical and critical, through the active response to the internet content, they can define their positions in the context of other writings, and they can establish their own perspectives on specific topics.
