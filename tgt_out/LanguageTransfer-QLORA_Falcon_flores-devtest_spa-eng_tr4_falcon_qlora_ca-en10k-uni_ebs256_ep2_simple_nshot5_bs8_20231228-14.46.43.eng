In addition to confirming that at least some dinosaurs were feathery, a widely accepted theory, the study also offers specific data that fossils generally do not, such as their color and three-dimensional structure.
According to experts, this bird has a reddish-brown plumage on the upper part and a pale or carotenoid color on the lower part.
Moreover, the discovery helps us understand better the evolution of bird feathers.
Since the dinosaur's plumage lacks a well-developed axis, called a rakish, but does have other feather features (wings and feathers), the researchers came to the conclusion that the rakish is likely the result of an evolutionary development of these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that their function was not related to flight, but rather to regulate temperature or as an indicator of the same. Researchers say that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample analyzed has the plumage of an adult and not of a chick.
The experts' comments were that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample illustrates more the plumage of an adult than that of a chick.

The 16th of February is the date on which Huhne and Pryce are scheduled to appear before the Westminster Magistrates' Court.
Nicholas Alden and Zachary Cuddeback, both 25 years old, died. Alden was driving.
Edgar Veguilla suffered injuries to his arm and jaw, while Kristoffer Schneider needed facial reconstruction surgery.
Uka's gun jammed while he was aiming at the head of a fifth man. Schneider suffers permanent pain, he can only see out of one eye, part of his skull is missing and his face was reconstructed with titanium.
Schneider testified via a virtual link from a U.S. Air Force base in his home country.
Carpanedo participated in two individual races apart from the Wednesday competition.
The first was the slalom, in which he obtained a "Did not finish first race" as well as 36 of the 116 participants in that race.
In her other event, the giant slalom, she finished tenth in the women's group with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes behind the first Austrian finalist, Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes behind the ninth finalist, Gyöngyi Dani, from Hungary.
Four slalom skiers in the sitting category did not complete their races and a total of 45 slalom giant skiers did not reach the qualification in the race.
The police force of Madhya Pradesh recovered the laptop and the mobile phone stolen.
Inspector General Arya said: "We arrested five individuals who abused the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop computer."
Baba, Bhutha, Rampro, Gaza and Vishnu Kanjar are the accused.
According to the police superintendent, Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the accused appeared before the court with their faces covered.
Despite there being three people inside the house at the time of the impact of the car, none of them suffered injuries.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was closed temporarily while emergency services removed the driver of the Audi TT red from the vehicle.
Initially, he was transferred to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been in the Edinburgh Sheriff Court, accused of murdering her son.
While she is under custody awaiting trial, any witness's testimony can be questioned, as her image has been widely disseminated.
It is a common practice in other parts of the UK, but as Scottish justice works differently, the courts considered the publication of photographs as potentially prejudicial.
Pamela Ferguson, a professor at the University of Dundee, said: "Journalists seem to be walking on dangerous ground when they publish photos or other information about suspects."
The Crown Prosecution Service, which handles the prosecutions, said it would not make any further comments until the case was formally closed.
According to the information that has been leaked, the document will deal with the border conflict, which Palestine wants to resolve based on the pre-1967 borders.
Other topics that were also discussed, according to the report, included the future of Jerusalem, which both nations consider sacred, and the problem of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a military presence in the valley for ten years after the agreement is signed, while PA only agrees to five.
During the supplementary pest control trial, the gamekeepers had to supervise the shooters closely, as this was being monitored and evaluated.
In a partnership between NPWS and the NSW Association of Sporting Shooters, volunteers were recruited from within the Association's program of hunting.
Mick O'Flynn, who is temporarily in charge of the Conservation and Heritage Office of the NPWS, said that comprehensive training and safety training was provided to the four shooters selected for the operation.
Yesterday, Martelly swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP, for its English initials) of nine members.
In four years, it is the fifth term of Martelly.
Last month, a presidential commission advised the CEP to resign, as part of a series of measures that aim to lead the country towards new elections.
The commission was the way that Martelly responded to the widespread protests that began in October against the regime.
The protests, sometimes violent, were sparked by the fact that no elections were held, in some cases since 2011.
About 60 cases of iPods with problems of malfunctioning and overheating have been reported, which have caused six fires and minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) reported that it had registered 27 accidents involving these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company classified as "not serious."
The ministry said it was "very disappointing" that Apple had not yet submitted its report.
Mariana was shaken by a 7.1-magnitude earthquake at 7:19 a.m. local time (21:19 GMT) on Friday.
The emergency management agency of the Northern Mariana Islands said there were no reports of damage on the territory.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also reported the absence of tsunami indicators.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former police officer kidnapped a bus and held tourists from Hong Kong hostage.
Rolando Mendoza opened fire with his M16 against the foreign visitors.
Several hostages have been rescued and, so far, at least six have died.
Both the six hostages, including children and the Filipino photographers, were released early.
Later, photographers took the place of an elderly woman because she needed to go to the bathroom. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began studying medicine.
She received training in obstetrics and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
Liggins began his research on premature birth in his spare time, while working in the hospital.
His study showed that the maturation of the fetal lungs could be accelerated through the administration of a hormone.
Xinhua reported on Wednesday that government investigators were able to recover the flight data recorders from the black box.
His fellow fighters also paid tribute.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first queen of Extreme. She died on the night of the two moons, something unique, like her. A strong woman."
Dustin Oro en Polvo Runnels said: "Luna was as strange as I was, even more so. I love her and I miss her. I hope she's in a better place."
Between 2008 and 2010, the number of people who said they would vote against a republic increased by 8%.
Julia Gillard, interim prime minister, stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic once the term of Queen Elizabeth II ended.
34% of those surveyed share this view and want Queen Isabel II to be the last Queen of Australia.
In one end of the survey, 29% of people think Australia should become a republic as soon as possible; in the other, 31% think it should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medal winner in the 100-meter freestyle and 200-meter freestyle events and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but his physical condition has been questioned after his complaints.
He has not been able to take painkillers to relieve the pain, because they are banned in the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
Many people checked the discovery by using various types of hardware and software and it was announced on February 1.
Perhaps comets have served as a source of water for our planet, as well as organic matter, which has the ability to form proteins and support life.
The scientists' expectation is to understand how planets, including our own, were formed, given that comets have crashed into the Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office at the beginning of the year and last month signed a law that allows same-sex couples to marry.
He called the rumors "political gossip and nonsense."
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the Federal Aviation Administration, would reduce flight distances, saving millions of gallons of fuel a year, as well as carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology, in contrast to the old radar technology on the ground, to enable air traffic controllers to detect aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate data.
There will be no additional transport and the trains will not stop at Wembley. Parking for cars and the deterrent will not be available.
Due to the concern generated by the possible lack of transport, it was considered whether the game could be played closed doors, without the fans of the team.
On Thursday, the magazine Science reported on a study that informed about the appearance of a new species of bird in the Galápagos Islands.
Experts from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden announced that the new species evolved in just two generations, even though it was estimated to take much longer, due to the reproduction between a Darwin's finch endemic, Geospiza fortis, and a cactus finch migratory, Geospiza scandens.
Gold can take on any shape and be rolled into tiny figures.
Not only can it be hammered and rolled into sheets, but it can also be stretched into a very fine wire that can be twisted and braided.
It can be very thin and adhere to another metal. So thin was it that it was used to decorate hand-made books called "manuscripts illuminated."
This is called the pH of a chemical substance. You can make a pH indicator using red cabbage juice.
The colour of the cabbage juice will change depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical substance is.
The number of hydrogen ions (H in pH) present in the chemical product analyzed determines its pH level.
Hydrogen atoms are formed by a proton and an electron. Therefore, a hydrogen ion is the result of removing a proton from an electron.
Mix both dry powders together and, after mixing, with clean and wet hands, form a ball.
A reaction between the moisture in his hands and his outer layers will make them feel strange to the touch and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets with drainage in almost all houses, which were connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
In some homes in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece, traces of sewer systems were found.
They also had toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In the Roman civilization, public baths had toilets and some were shared by men and women.
When one communicates with someone who is miles away, one is using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and, then, reflects it back almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space through a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space, because the light from the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and vision we see.
A giant rocket is needed to carry a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in surprising ways. The most important thing it has done for us is to make travel much easier and faster.
Thanks to her today we have many means of transport, such as the railway or the car, among many others.
Below, there are medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey, such as rabbits, deer, and antelope.
Finally, there are many small wild cats (including domestic cats) that feed on species of small size that are much more numerous, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The success of the company is the concept of niche: each cat has a particular function, which prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the cats that socialize the most and their lives take place in large groups called prides.
The herds are formed by one to three adult males from the same family group, up to thirty females and their offspring.
Generally, females are very close to each other, which makes them a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides have the same behaviour as wolf packs or dogs, with which they share a surprising similarity (unlike other large cats) in their behaviour and that they are highly lethal to their prey.
The tiger is a complete athlete, it can climb (but not very well), swim, dive, and pull five times stronger than a strong person.
The tiger is of the same genus (Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These are the only four big cats capable of roaring.
The roar of the tiger is not a full-bodied roar like that of the lion, but rather a series of words spoken in growls and shouts.
Ocelots enjoy eating small creatures. In most cases, they will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Almost all of their prey will be much smaller than them.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find prey (food) by using their sense of smell, smelling the ground where they have passed.
They have very good night vision and in dark places, and they also move very quietly. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then pounce on them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) moves away from the main population from which they come (for example, if they move to a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment than they are used to.
The new environment has different resources and competitors, so a new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor.
There have been no changes in the original population, which still need the same adaptations as in the past.
As time goes by, as the new population adapts to the new environment, it begins to look less like the other population.
Finally, after millions or even billions of years, the two populations will be so different that they will no longer be considered the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the development of new species, and is an inevitable and fundamental part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that people breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that they exhale (which they exhale).
Plants generate food with solar energy, thanks to photosynthesis. They also offer shade.
We build our houses from the plants and with them we also make clothes. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without them, animals would not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the top predator of its time, so it had nothing to fear, except from other members of its own species.
His long jaws had more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, as well as another group in the palate, which translates into anything that came in front of him, had no escape.
We don't know for sure, but it could have been a viperine. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs and even could have been a cannibal.
He also attacked any creature that entered the water: even a dinosaur as large as T. Rex was no threat to him.
While most of the food we eat today would be familiar to Romans, they also ate some unusual items at banquets, such as wild boar, pheasants, snails and even a type of rodent, the dormouse.
Another thing that distinguished the rich from the poor was that the poor ate sitting down on a chair, while the rich enjoyed sharing banquets and reclining while eating.
It is not possible that the recipes of ancient Rome included foods that came to Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
In other words, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no chocolate, and no Roman ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built temples for each of their gods, considered their home.
People brought sacrifices to the gods and priests tried to meet the needs of those celebrating ceremonies and festivals.
Temples have an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary where only the priests could enter.
Sometimes, special pyramidal towers were built, called ziggurats, to be part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for his deity.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was of little importance.
Jewish families spent most of their time outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were only showrooms that faced the street. Houses were built with stone.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests; therefore, wood was very expensive.
Very few people lived in Greenland. According to Nordic sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, during a voyage westward, discovered the island and gave it his name.
However, despite his discovery, the Eskimos had already inhabited the area by that time.
While each country was Scandinavian, there were marked differences in relation to the people, the monarchs, the habits and the history between Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie Treasure Island, you may believe that a map of the treasure was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. While the reverse of the document contains something written, it is not a map of a treasure.
The Declaration of Independence has the words "Declaration of Independence original July 4, 1776" written on its reverse side. The text is on the bottom of the document, facing down.
Although it is not known who wrote it, it is known that the huge document of parchment (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up to be stored.
Therefore, it is likely that the notation was added only as a label.
Although the D-Day landings and subsequent battles had liberated the north of France, the south still remained.
His government was in the hands of the French "Vichy" group, which in 1940 had agreed to peace with the Germans and worked with the invaders instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, Operation Dragoon, the Allied invasion of southern France, began.
In just two weeks, the American and French forces had liberated the south of France and were heading for Germany.
A civilization can be defined as a specific culture that forms part of a large group of people who live and work together; that is, a society.
Civilization derives from the Latin civilis, which means civil, and relates both to the word civis, from the same language, which means citizen, as to civitas, which means city or city state, and which, in addition, somehow determines the size of the society.
State cities are the precursors of nations. A culture of civilization has a long generational transmission of knowledge, a durable cultural legacy and a homogeneous propagation.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving any significant historical traces, and are not recognized as proper civilizations.
During the American Revolution, the thirteen states formed, at first, a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation, in which the Congress was its only component.
The Congress did not have the power to levy taxes, and since it had a national executive or judicial power, this function fell to the states, which often did not cooperate to enforce all of its laws.
He was not empowered to annul tax laws or customs between states.
The articles demanded unanimous approval from all the states to proceed with their amendment and the states gave so little importance to the central government that their representatives often absented themselves.
The Italian national football team, along with the selected team from Germany, is the second team with the most wins in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among the sports that are most popular are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, figure skating and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern regions, with athletes who participate in international tournaments and Olympic events.
There are about 7,000 islands in Japan (the largest is Honshu), making it the seventh largest archipelago in the world.
Due to the conglomerate/group of islands that it contains, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago," from a geographical point of view.
The history of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors who sailed through the area registered the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, which means Beautiful Island.
The establishment, in 1624, by the Dutch East India Company of a base in the southwest of Taiwan, began a transformation in the indigenous method of grain production, with the employment of Chinese labour to work in their rice and sugar plantations.
The Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the coastal region of Taiwan in 1683 and declared this region as a dependent province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after having been defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, through which it ceded sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which retained control over the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three main buildings: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings in the complex have been rebuilt at the ends to allow tourists to see how they originally looked.
By 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu had been restored and work continues today.
For example, the most common format for still photography around the world is 35mm, which was the most commonly used film size towards the end of the era of film photography.
Today it is still produced, but the most important thing is that its dimensional relationship has been transferred to the formats of digital camera sensors.
In truth, the 35mm format is a bit confusing, as its measurements are 36mm wide by 24mm high.
Therefore, it is said that the dimensional relationship of this format (dividing by twelve to calculate the simplest integer ratio) is 3:2.
Many typical formats (for example, the APS group) are similar or very similar to this relationship of appearance.
The rule of thirds, which has been the subject of constant ridicule and many times mocked, is a simple rule that generates dynamism while also allowing for some order to be given to the images.
Indicates that the most effective place to put the central object is the intersection formed by the horizontal and vertical lines that divide the image into thirds (see example).
During this phase of the history of Europe, the Catholic Church, which had accumulated wealth and power, was questioned.
For more than a millennium, Christianity had united the European states despite their different languages and customs.
His power, present everywhere, affected everyone, from the monarch to the people.
One of the most important principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that church funds should be used for that specific purpose.
The central dome of the church had remained in Rome for more than a thousand years and this concentration of power and money made many wonder if this principle was being respected.
Soon after the war began, the British began a naval blockade of Germany.
Although the strategy, which involved the interruption of vital military and civilian supplies, was successful, such measures violated the generally recognized international legal principle and were contained in several international agreements of the last two centuries.
Britain extracted water from international waters in whole sectors of the ocean to block the entry of ships, even risking the safety of neutral ships.
Having received a reduced response to this tactic, Germany thought it would meet a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the attitude adopted by most citizens and nations was that of pacifism and isolation.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities that occurred during World War I, the countries wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job at Edison in New York.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents, a book of poems and a recommendation letter from his last employer, Charles Batchelor (his manager in his last job) and addressed to Thomas Edison.
The ancient China had a unique way of delimiting the different time periods. Each dynasty or each ruling family constituted a different dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there was also a period of instability, with provinces divided. The most well-known was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years, between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these stages, a bloody war broke out between many nobles who were fighting for the throne.
One of the bloodiest periods in the history of Ancient China was the Three Kingdoms, where thousands of people died in a struggle to occupy the throne of the great palace in Xi'an.
The consequences of the French Revolution were many, including the use of the metric system, the displacement of absolutism towards republicanism, nationalism and the conviction that the country belongs to the people, not to a single sovereign.
Likewise, after the Revolution, the posts were open to all male candidates, which allowed the success of the most ambitious and prestigious.
The same thing happens with the military, because now the charges are based on the caliber.
The French Revolution was also an inspiration for many other people in the oppressed working class to start their own revolutions.
Mohammed was deeply interested in matters beyond this earthly life. He often visited a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain of "Noor" (light) to meditate.
The cave itself, which has endured over time, realistically illustrates the spiritual inclinations of Muhammad.
At the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, lies a cave completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is very difficult to find, even if one was sure of its existence. Inside the cave, isolation is total.
Nothing can be seen but the wonderful clear sky and the many mountains in the vicinity. From the inside of this cave, one can see or hear very little of this world.
Of the seven wonders, the only one still standing is the Great Pyramid of Giza.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptian people in the third century BC, is one of many pyramids of large size and pyramid shape built to worship the deceased pharaoh.
The Necropolis of Guiza, or "Valley of the Kings," in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, contains numerous pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of the Pharaoh Khufu, and many other pyramids of this type, tombs and smaller temples were built in honor of his wives and family.
The "upward arrow" mark is similar to a V and the "downward arrow" mark is similar to a square or a rectangle without its bottom edge.
Above means to start at the tip and push the bow, and below means to start at the frog, where the hand holds the bow, and pull it.
The ascending arc generates a softer sound, while a descending arc is more forceful and abrupt.
Feel free to make your own marks with pencil, but don't forget that marks on string instruments have been printed in that place for a musical purpose and, therefore, should be respected.
On October 6, 1789, a mob of women from the market forced King Louis XVI, his wife Marie Antoinette, their two small children (Marie Teresa, 11, and Louis Charles, 4) and his sister, Madam Elizabeth, to return to Paris from Versailles.
They returned to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd that shouted and threatened the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriage completely.
At one point, a participant in the revolt shook the head of a executed guard in front of the queen, who was terrified.
The Filipino people paid the costs of the imperialism of the United States in the conquest of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial government of the United States with the purpose of paying most of the expenses and interest on the bonds that fluctuated in the name of the Filipino government in the banks of Wall Street.
From the very beginning, the long-term profits from the exploitation of the Filipino people would be the main source of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, you need to understand the context that led to the establishment of the order.
The historical period in which these events took place is known as the Middle Ages, between the years 1000 and 1300 (that is, between the years 1000 and 1300).
The Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages which, by convention, ended around 1500.
Determinism is a concept that encompasses a broad range of ideas, from the technological imperative to a strict sense of there being a logic underlying the destiny of humanity and how it relates to the laws of science and how they are expressed in technology.
Almost all interpretations of technological determinism have in common two general ideas: that technological development unfolds on its own independent of any cultural or political influence, and that technology has "effects" on societies that are inherent and not socially conditioned.
For example, one could argue that the existence of automobiles necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a national network of roads is not economically viable for a small number of cars, so new techniques of manufacturing are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The widespread use of automobiles also leads to a greater incidence of traffic accidents, which leads to the development of new techniques in the field of health to repair damaged bodies.
The element of cultural determinism was very present in romanticism, according to scholars like Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the Romantic context, geography shaped people and, over time, customs and cultures related to that geography developed that, being in harmony with the location of that society, were preferred to laws imposed arbitrarily.
As Paris is known as the fashion capital today, Constantinople was considered as such in the feudal Europe.
Its fame as the epicenter of luxury began approximately 400 BC and extended until approximately 1100 AD.
During the twelfth century its status declined, especially due to the return of the Crusaders, who brought back silk and spices, which were valued more highly than goods offered in Byzantine markets.
The title of "fashion capital" was passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The pinnacle of the Gothic style occurred between the 10th and 14th centuries.
At first, the way people dressed was heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to the slow communication channels, western styles could take a delay of 25 to 30 years.
In the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most significant advances of this time was that, as a result of the Crusades, people began to use buttons to fasten their clothes.
Subsistence farming is understood as that which produces enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple practice, usually organic, that combines the use of seeds from the region's original ecological region with crop rotation and other relatively simple methods to maximize production.
Historically, most of the main activity of farmers was subsistence farming, which is still practiced in many developing countries.
Subcultures gather individuals with similar ideas and feelings of marginality from the standards of society and provide them with the opportunity to generate a sense of identity.
There are many factors that can distinguish subcultures: age, ethnicity, class, location or gender of their members.
The distinguishing features of a subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, sexual, geographical, or related to religion or politics, or a combination of factors.
It is common for members of a subculture to exhibit distinctive and symbolic features of their belonging by using distinctive and symbolic styles, such as fashion, gestures and slang.
One of the most common mechanisms for graphing the importance of socializing is to analyze the few and lamentable cases of children who, through negligence, misfortune or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults during their growth.
These children are called "wild." Some wild children are confined by people, usually their parents. In some cases, the abandonment of a child is due to the rejection of parents of a child with severe intellectual or physical disability.
It is possible that the wild children may have suffered traumatic or severe abuse before being abandoned or running away.
It is said that others were raised by animals and that some have lived in the wild.
When a child is raised exclusively by animals different from humans, it exhibits behaviors (within its physical capabilities) almost equal to those of the specific animal that cared for it, as well as its fear or indifference towards people.
Although learning based on projects should make the process easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a little further.
The scaffolding is not a learning technique; it is, rather, a support that provides assistance to those who are experiencing a new experience, such as the use of a new computer program or the beginning of a new project.
The scaffolding can be presented in real or virtual form; to put it another way, a teacher is a type of scaffolding, but also a small animated subject from Microsoft Office is a type of scaffolding.
Virtual scaffolding is incorporated into the software and its function is to question, stimulate or explain procedures that may have been difficult for the student to understand on their own.
Children are placed in foster homes for a wide variety of reasons, from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment where there is no love, care and education; but it happens.
We can see that the family-based system provides a safe environment for these children.
The goal of our foster care system is to provide safe homes, loving foster parents, sustained education and reliable medical care.
The goal of the foster care program is to meet all the needs that were not met in the home of the child before they were placed in foster care.
The Internet unites and mixes components of mass communication and between people.
The different features of the Internet open up new dimensions from the perspective of the concept of uses and rewards.
For example, learning and socialization are significant incentives for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
During a study of user reactions to websites conducted by Eighmey and McCord (1998), "personal participation" and "lasting relationships" were also identified as new motivational factors.
Through the recording of videos, important discoveries have been made in the interpretation of microexpressions, which are facial movements lasting only a few hundredths of a second.
Specifically, it is claimed that by reading microexpressions, it is possible to detect if a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, explained how those who cannot understand speech due to a brain injury can, however, evaluate sincerity with precision.
He also suggests that the skills for interpreting human behavior can be shared with animals, such as domestic dogs.
Through the research of the 20th century, it has been proven that there are two types of genetic variation: hidden and visible.
The process of mutation incorporates a new genetic variation; the process of selection removes it from that set of variations.
Segregation and recombination bargain the variation between one generation and the next.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate, whose digestive system is similar to that of humans, to satisfy its amino acid needs with the vegetable resources available.
Not doing so can have serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The proteins present in the leaves and legumes would have been the easiest source of vegetable protein, but they are not easily digested by primates like us, except when cooked.
However, animal-derived foods (ants, termites, eggs) are easy to digest and provide a large number of proteins that contain all the essential amino acids.
In the end, it shouldn't surprise us if our own ancestors solved their "protein problems" in the same way that chimpanzees in the savannah do today.
The interruption of sleep consists of waking up on purpose during the normal sleep period and then going back to sleep after a short time (10 to 60 minutes).
This can be easily achieved with a relatively soft alarm clock that will wake you up without fully waking you up.
The registration is an additional requirement for the visa process. In some countries, you will need to register your presence and the address of your accommodation with local authorities.
Other options that are based on the biological rhythm include drinking a lot of liquid (especially water or tea, known as a diuretic) before going to bed, which will make you get up to urinate.
The level of inner peace a person enjoys is related to the amount of tension in their body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive is the force of life with which we are endowed. Each one of us has the potential to find peace and absolute happiness.
We can all achieve enlightenment. The only thing that stands in our way is our own tension and negativity.
While the basis of Tibetan Buddhism are the teachings of Buddha, they extended through the path of Mahayana love and many techniques of yoga from India.
In general, laísmo is very simple. It is based on kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of love that encompasses everything.
In Kundalini Yoga, the energy Kundalini (illumination) is activated through yoga poses, breathing practices, mantras or visualization.
Tibetan meditation focuses on the Devata Yoga. Through visualization of different deities, the energy channels can be cleared, the chakras activated and the consciousness of enlightenment developed.
The cooperation between the USSR and the USA was the result of facing a common enemy, Germany, during World War II. After the war, the Cold War, the system, process and culture began to distance the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, those who were allies now became enemies and the Cold War began.
The war would last for the next 40 years and would be fought through proxy wars, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, among many other places.
Due to the fact that Poland's defense was already broken down by September 17, 1939, its only hope was to retreat and reorganize in the Romanian extension of the head of the bridge.
However, these plans fell into disuse almost overnight, when more than 800,000 Red Army soldiers entered and formed the fronts of Belarus and Ukraine after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international, bilateral, and multilateral agreements.
Using ships to transport goods is a much more efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across the oceans.
The function of the navy has always been to ensure that its country can move its population and goods, while at the same time interfering with the enemy's ability to do the same.
The campaign in the North Atlantic during World War II offers one of the clearest and most recent examples of this. The Americans were trying to transport men and materials across the Atlantic in order to support Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly submarines, was trying to cut off this traffic.
If the Allies had not been successful, Germany could have taken power in Britain, just as it did in other European countries.
It seems that goats were domesticated for the first time, about 10,000 years ago, in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
With the purpose of easily obtaining their milk, hair, meat and leather, the ancient peoples and tribes started to take them.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills or other areas of pasture, tended by herdsmen who were often children or teenagers, similar to the most popular shepherd.
In England, railways had been installed in the 16th century.
Although the rails of the cars were made of simple parallel wooden boards, they allowed the horses pulling them to achieve a greater speed and carry heavier loads than on the slightly rougher roads of the day.
Sleepers were used to keep the rails in place early on. However, gradually, it was realized that the rails would be more efficient if they were covered with iron on their upper part.
This became a common practice, although iron wheels caused greater wear on the wooden wheels of the carriages.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels, and in 1767 iron rails were used for the first time.
The first form of transport known was walking. Humans began doing it upright two million years ago with the appearance of the Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not have the habit of walking upright.
While bipedal footprints have been found in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, it is possible that Sahelanthropus walked on two legs 7 million years ago.
We can begin to live more friendly lives with the planet, join environmental movements or even become activists and fight to lessen, in some way, the future suffering.
It's like the treatment asintomático. But if we are looking for a long-term solution, we should find the root of the problems and try to eliminate them.
It is clear that the world has undergone great changes, due to technological and scientific advances by humanity, and problems have intensified due to overpopulation and extravagant lifestyles.
After being approved by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft was sent to the printer, John Dunlap, a few blocks away.
Copies were made, during the night, between 150 and 200, which are now known as the "Dunlap copies."
It was John Nixon who read the document for the first time in the patio of the Independence Hall, on July 8.
On July 6, a copy was sent to George Washington, who ordered that it be read to his army in New York on July 9. On August 10, another copy arrived in London.
The 25 photographs of Dunlap, which are known to still exist, are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original manuscript is lost.
A large number of paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive today. They are birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs, because they have feathers and can fly.
However, there are many features in birds that still make them similar to dinosaurs.
They have scaly skin and sharp claws, lay eggs and move on their hind legs like the T-Rex.
Currently, almost all computers function by manipulating data in the binary system.
A binary number can only have two values, they are 0 and 1, and, according to computer jargon, these numbers are known as binary digits, or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately evident. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are too common to be able to give an immediate diagnosis.
The clearest sign of internal poisoning is finding an open bottle of medicine or cleaning chemicals.
Read the label for specific information about the first aid measures for that specific poison.
Entomologists use the term parasite in a formal sense to refer to this group of arthropods.
The word comes from its old relationship with fleas, a species very developed to parasitize humans.
Bedbugs are nidicolous; they are adapted to live in the nest or home of their host.
The number of cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the United States is estimated to be around 400,000, making it the most common neurological disease among young adults and middle-aged adults.
The central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve, is the target of multiple sclerosis.
The studies indicate that women have twice the chance of men to suffer from EM.
A couple might decide that raising a child would not be the best thing for them or for the child.
These couples could choose to adopt a baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights so that a different couple can take care of the child.
The main goal of science is to decipher how the world works through the scientific method. Indeed, this method serves as a guide for most scientific research.
It is not an experiment, however, but a test that is used to discard one or more of the possible hypotheses, making questions and observations that guide scientific research.
The focus of both naturalists and philosophers was on the classical works; especially, in the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle's thoughts, especially those on science, were accepted.
As the Greek language was declining, the West distanced itself from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Often, many rhythms present in physiological processes and in behavior depend decisively on internal cycles and their production through biological clocks.
The periodic rhythms, which are not only responses to regular external stimuli, have been recorded in almost all living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks oscillate autonomously and have a free-running period even if there are no external stimuli.
One of the key indicators that DNA was a type of genetic material was the experiment conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase inserted their own DNA into a bacteria using viruses.
They performed two experiments in which they marked the DNA of the frog with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the DNA with radioactive sulfur.
Depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether it involves germ cells, the mutation can have various effects.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations in other cells can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism usually attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, which includes wild animal and plant life.
Some examples of possible activities in the area are: hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, taking photographs and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in their cars to go to their jobs and often cross paths with others whose jobs are in the place they just left.
In this dynamic transfer vehicle, everyone is somehow connected to a transportation system based on the use of private cars, and supports it.
Currently, scientists argue that this massive economy of carbon has deprived the biosphere of one of its regular states that has contributed to the evolution of humanity over the last two million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses the transportation systems; and almost everyone complains about them.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear complaints about the quality of water or the collapse of bridges.
What is the reason that transportation systems give rise to such complaints and why do failures occur daily? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is there something more substantial happening?
Traffic flow is the study of the individual movement of drivers and vehicles between two points and of their interactions.
Unfortunately, it is not an easy task to study the flow of traffic, since it is not possible to make exact predictions about the behavior of drivers.
Fortunately, there is a tendency in drivers to maintain a relatively consistent behavior, which allows traffic flows to have a logical consistency and can be represented approximately mathematically.
To graphically illustrate the flow of traffic, three important relationships were established: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships facilitate both the planning and design of road vehicles as well as their operations.
The first species to take to the air were insects. This helped them to evade their enemies more easily and to find food and a mate more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back, sticking them to the sides of their bodies.
This provides a wider range of possible small places to hide from predators.
Currently, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are the anisoptera and the ephemeroptera.
Millennia ago, a man named Aristarchus commented that the Solar System revolved around the Sun.
There were those who shared his theory, but many others believed the opposite: that the solar system orbited the Earth, even the Sun and other stars.
This seems to make sense, since on Earth we do not perceive its movement, right?
The Amazon River is the longest and second-largest river in the world. It contains eight times more water than the river that follows it in size.
The Amazon is the widest river in the world, in some places with a width of up to six miles.
Of the total water that comes from the world's rivers and ends up in the oceans, 20 percent comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River has a length of 6,387 km (3,967 miles) and receives water from thousands of smaller rivers.
While stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Ancient Kingdom, they never surpassed the size or the sublime technique of the pyramids of Guiza.
The ancient Egyptian town of New Kingdom was amazed by the monuments of their ancestors, which dated back more than a thousand years.
With approximately 800 inhabitants, the Vatican City is the world's smallest independent country and the least populated.
Italian is used in the Vatican to write its legislation and to issue its official communiques.
The language that most people working in the state use daily is Italian, and the use of Latin is generally reserved for religious ceremonies.
All citizens living in the Vatican City are Catholic.
The basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper are known since ancient times, since they can be found in nature in their original form and are relatively easy to extract with rudimentary tools.
Aristotle developed the theory that everything is made up of a combination of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air and fire.
It was similar to the states of matter (with the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, but it also had the theory that they transform into new substances that make up the things we see.
Alloys are, basically, a combination of two or more metals. Remember that the periodic table has many elements.
Metals are considered to be elements such as calcium and potassium. From the beginning, there are also metals such as gold and silver.
It is also possible that there are alloys with small amounts of carbon, which are not metals.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter, composed of tiny particles called atoms.
The size of atoms is so incredibly small that the end of this sentence could contain billions of them.
Therefore, when the pencil was invented, it gained many friends.
Unfortunately, due to the implementation of new writing methods, the pencil is used less and has lost its status.
Today, people write messages on their computer screens. They don't even need to get close to a pencil.
Now the question is what will happen to the keyboard when something new comes along.
The atomic bomb works on the principle that energy is required to form a nucleus with a large number of protons and neutrons.
It's similar to what happens when a heavy car rolls up a hill. By splitting the nucleus once again, it releases some of that energy.
Some atomic nuclei are unstable, that is, they tend to break down with a minimum or almost no push.
The surface of the moon is composed of rocks and dust and its outer layer is called the crust.
The crust has a thickness of about 70 km on the near side and about 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under the lunar seas and thicker under the highlands.
It is possible that there are more volcanoes on the side closer to the sea because their crust is thinner, which made it easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on what attracts or pleases people.
These doctrines hold that people have certain needs or desires that have been internalized as they grew to maturity.
These theories analyze what causes people to want the things they do and what factors in their environment force them to do or not do certain things.
Two very well-known theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, there are two types of behavior that managers exhibit when they begin to lead their former colleagues. On one end of the spectrum is the attempt to continue being "one of the guys" (or girls).
To managers in this category it is difficult to make decisions that are unpopular with employees, impose disciplinary measures, carry out performance reviews, assign responsibilities and demand accountability from staff.
On the other end of the spectrum, someone becomes an unrecognizable person who believes that everything that the group has been doing up until now needs to be changed and done their way.
In the end, the success or failure of the team is ultimately the responsibility of the leader.
This type of behavior often distances the leaders from the rest of the team.
The same standards of excellence that apply to conventional teams apply to virtual teams, although there are some small differences.
Often, members of a virtual team operate as a point of contact for their physical team.
Generally, they enjoy greater autonomy than members of a traditional group, because their teams can meet at different times that, for example, might not be understood by local management.
The existence of an "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique element of virtual teams.
The "invisible team" is the group in charge of managing and to which each member reports. It is the one that sets the standards for each member.
What reason could an organization have for submitting to the process of establishing an organization for learning? One of the purposes of applying the theoretical concepts of organizational learning is to promote innovation.
When all the resources available are used appropriately in the operational departments of an organization, there is space for creativity and ingenuity.
As a result, it is possible that an organization that works together to overcome a place-based difficulty to innovate a new process to meet the needs of customers.
To make an organization innovative, leadership must first generate a culture of innovation, as well as a shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains continuous improvement as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data offers factual evidence for a theoretical approach to cognitive research. This reduces the field of research and gives it greater accuracy.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior contributes to the research of scientists.
It has been known for a long time that many types of brain damage, trauma, lesions and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in mental functions.
Thanks to the rise of new technologies, we now have the ability to see and investigate structures and processes that have never been seen before in the brain.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to develop simulation models, which help us understand the mental processes.
While artificial intelligence is often associated with science fiction, it is a very important field within computer science, which deals with the behaviour, learning and intelligent adaptation of machines.
The field of AI involves the development of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples of this include monitoring, planning and programming, the ability to respond to diagnostic queries and customer queries, as well as facial recognition, handwriting recognition and voice recognition.
These issues have become separate disciplines, focused on offering solutions to real-world problems.
Artificial Intelligence is now used frequently in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and military, just as it was incorporated into various applications of video games and personal computers.
Study trips are an important part of any classroom. It is very common for a teacher to want to take her students to places that are not accessible by bus.
The solution comes from technology, through virtual tours. Students can observe the objects on display in a museum, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful works of art sitting with their class.
Sharing a virtual tour is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, the students at Bennet High School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital and each year the website is updated, but the previous versions are kept online as a memory album.
Blogs can also help improve student writing. Even though students often begin their blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, this usually changes when they have an audience.
Because students are often the most critical readers, the blogger begins to try to improve his writing, in order to avoid criticism.
Blogging also requires students to be more aware of the world around them. The need to engage the audience inspires them to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a resource that inspire collaboration and encourage students to go beyond the typical school day.
The appropriate use of blogs can empower students to be more analytical and critical, through the active response to internet content, students can define their positions in the context of the writings of others, and establish their perspectives on specific topics
Ottawa is the captivating bilingual capital of Canada and boasts a variety of museums and art galleries that showcase the history and the present of the country.
The Niagara Falls are located more south and the north hosts the natural beauty without exploiting it in Muskoka and the extension that follows.
These aspects, among others, are what make Ontario intrinsically Canadian in the eyes of foreigners.
The large areas to the north are sparsely populated and some are wild lands, almost uninhabited.
For a comparison that causes many to be surprised, more African Americans live in the United States than in Canada.
The location of the islands of East Africa is on the eastern coast of that continent, in the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar is, by far, the largest and a continent in itself when we talk about wild life.
Most of the smaller islands are independent or associated with France and are popular for their beaches and luxury tourist complexes.
Islam was also brought to the lands by the Arabs and was largely imposed in the Comoros and Mayotte.
The initial influence of Europe and colonialism took place in the 15th century, following the discovery, by the Portuguese explorer, Vasco da Gama, of the route that links the Cape of Good Hope with India.
The region borders the Sahel to the north, and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that all female visitors say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It will also be useful to use a ring (just make sure it doesn't look too expensive).
Women must be aware that cultural differences can provoke what they consider harassment, and that it is not uncommon for them to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be round to reject men and not fear defending your position (cultural differences or not, that's not correct!).
The founders of the modern city of Casablanca were the Berber fishermen during the 10th century and the Phoenicians, Romans and Greeks used it as a strategic port, called Anfa.
It was destroyed and rebuilt by the Portuguese with the name of White House, but in 1755 it was abandoned after the occurrence of an earthquake.
The city was rebuilt by Sultan Mohammed of Morocco with the name Daru l-Badya and the Spanish traders who set up their businesses there called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the most boring places in Morocco to go shopping.
In the surrounding area of the old Medina, there are many places where you can buy traditional Moroccan goods, such as earthenware pots, leather goods, water pipes and a whole range of other knick-knacks, but everything is geared towards tourists.
Goma is a tourist destination in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, close to Rwanda.
In 2002, the lava from the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma and left much of its streets submerged, especially in the city center.
While Goma is fairly safe, any trip outside the city should be considered to learn about the situation in the Kivu province of North.
Kigali is also the base for climbing the volcano Nyiragongo and its gorilla trekking excursions are some of the most affordable in Africa.
To get around Goma, you can take a motorcycle taxi (mototaxi). The regular fare (local) is CDF500 (Congolese francs) for a short ride.
This, coupled with the fact that it is relatively inaccessible, has given "Tombuctú" an exotic and distant image.
Although today Tombuctú is a poor city, it still has an airport and its reputation makes it a tourist attraction.
In 1990, it was added to the World Heritage List, due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the most important stops on the special Maravillas del mundo africano, by Henry Louis Gates, on PBS.
The city contrasts greatly with the rest of the country, as it has a more Arab style than African.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and extends along the border with Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park has a surface area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which has a different wild life.
This is one of the most important attractions in South Africa and is recognized as the main icon of the National Parks of South Africa (SANParks).
As in all South African nature reserves, there are daily fees for conservation and access to the park.
It is also convenient to buy a Wild Card that allows entry to selected parks in South Africa or to all the National Parks in the country.
The territory of Hong Kong takes its name from the island of Hong Kong, which is the main attraction for most tourists.
Hong Kong's skyline has been compared to a bar chart that shows the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
The best way to enjoy the best views of Hong Kong is to leave the island and head to Kowloon Bay, located in front.
It is in the reclaimed land on the north coast of Hong Kong where its urban development is most dense.
This is the site that the British conquerors adopted as their own. Therefore, if you want to see evidence of the past colonial history of this region, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the world's largest mangrove forest, with a length of 80 km (50 miles) from the coast of Bangladesh and India.
The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has declared the Sundarbans a World Heritage Site.
Despite this, the forests are not just mangroves, but also some of the last remaining trees of the once-impressive forests that once covered the Gangetic plains.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 km2 and about a third of its area is covered by water or swamp.
The Sundarbans have been, since 1966, a temple of the wild life and it is estimated that there are currently 400 tigers in the area of Bengal and 30 000 spotted deer.
Buses leave the station in the other side of the river throughout the day, but most of them, especially those going east and to Jakar (also called Bumthang), leave between 6:30 and 7:30 a.m.
Due to the fact that buses between districts are often full of passengers, it is recommended to buy a ticket in advance.
Almost all districts have the Coaster buses, which are comfortable and durable.
Sharing a taxi is a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (150 ngultrums) and Punakha (200 ngultrums).
The bridge over the Oyapock River is an attractive structure that crosses it, connecting Oiapoque, Brazil, and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 m, with a length of 378 m and two lanes of 3.5 m width.
Below the bridge there is a 15-metre-wide space and, although construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The full operation of the bridge is expected to be in September 2017, which is when it is expected that Brazilian customs controls will be completed.
The area that is now the east of Paraguay was inhabited by the Guarani, who were the most important indigenous group in that region and who lived as nomadic hunters, as well as practicing subsistence farming.
The region was home to other indigenous groups, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who hunted, gathered and fished as a means of subsistence.
Paraguay, formerly known as "The giant province of the Indies," was born in the 16th century, as a result of the meeting between the Spanish conquerors and the native Indian peoples.
The Spanish began the stage of colonization, which lasted for three centuries.
Since Paraguay was established in 1537, it has been able to preserve much of its indigenous identity and culture.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best teams and best players in the world.
The most important tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
Other tournaments and lower-level games are also played throughout the year.
On the website of the Argentine Association of Polo you will find information about the tournaments and where to buy tickets for the polo games.
The value of the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), the official currency of the Falkland Islands, is fixed in relation to the British pound (GBP).
There is only one bank on the islands. You can change your money there. It is in front of the FIC West store in Stanley.
Sterling is usually accepted everywhere within the islands. In Stanley, you can also pay with credit cards or US dollars.
There are chances that credit cards will not be accepted on the islands of the periphery, but cash from Britain or the United States can be used. Ask the owners in advance to find out which method of payment is accepted.
It is practically impossible to change money from the Falkland Islands outside the archipelago, so try to do it before leaving.
Because Montevideo is south of Ecuador, there is summer when in the northern hemisphere is winter and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics, with frequent temperatures above +30° C during the summer.
Winter cold can be deceptive: though it is rare for temperatures to fall below the freezing point, wind and humidity interact to make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no "rainy" or "dry" stations; the amount of rain is almost the same throughout the year.
While many animals in the park are accustomed to seeing people, the wild life is still wild, so don't feed it or disturb it.
According to the authorities of the parks, you must keep at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters from other wild animals.
Although they may appear to be gentle, bison, bighorn sheep, elk, bears and most large animals can be aggressive.
Dozens of visitors suffer injuries every year by not maintaining a safe distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous; therefore, respect their space.
Also remember that bears and other wild animals are attracted to food smells, so you should avoid cooking food that releases a lot of smell and keep the camp clean.
The capital of Samoa, Apia, is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of around 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and is the capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, the port was the scene of a disastrous naval confrontation when seven German, American and English ships refused to leave the port.
All the ships sank, except for a British cruiser. About two hundred Americans and Germans died.
During the Mau movement, a peaceful meeting in the city ended with the assassination of the state's leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches in Auckland due to the fact that it has two ports. The most famous ones are in three areas.
In the North Harbour district of the Pacific Ocean, the beaches of North Shore stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
The beaches are almost all of sand with safe swimming areas and most have pohutukawa trees that offer shade.
In the port of Waitemata, the beaches of Tamaki Drive are spread out in the extravagant suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, in the central region of Auckland.
These are family beaches, sometimes very crowded, with numerous and varied shops available on the beach. They are also safe for swimming.
Number One is the local beer most popular and is not complicated, but rather refreshing and pleasant.
While there is a great variety of French wines, those from New Zealand and Australia might be considered better for transporting.
The local water from the tap is completely safe for consumption, but if you are concerned, you can easily find bottled water.
Australians consider the idea of "white coffee" foreign. A small black coffee is called "espresso," cappuccino is served with cream (instead of foam) and tea is not taken with milk.
Hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards. The fruit juices are expensive, but delicious.
Many trips are made to the reef throughout the year and, there, injuries from any of these causes are rare.
However, he accepted the advice of the authorities, respected all the signs and paid special attention to security alerts.
The jellies are found near beaches and estuaries of rivers from October to April, north of 1770.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack people. Most of them fear them and would swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles are not found in the ocean. Their primary habitat is the estuaries of the rivers that are located north of Rockhampton.
The advance booking of accommodation gives you the peace of mind that you will have somewhere to stay when you arrive at your destination.
Travel agents usually have agreements with specific hotels, but through them you can also book other types of accommodation, such as camping sites.
Generally, travel agents offer packages that include breakfast, transfers from and to the airport, and even combined flight and accommodation packages.
They can also keep the reservation in case they need time to think about the offer, or to obtain other documents for their destination (for example, a visa).
However, any modification or request must be made through the travel agent first, and not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, most attendees camp at the event and most attendees consider camping to be a key part of the experience.
If you want to see the action up close, then you should arrive early at the campsite to get a good spot for the musical events.
It is important to note that, while the musical performances may have ended, in other areas of the festival the music may continue until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are going to cross the Baltic Sea in winter, find out where the cabin is located, because crossing the ice generates a very annoying noise for those most affected.
During the cruises to St. Petersburg, there is time in the city. Those who disembark are exempt from visa requirements (see terms).
Casinos normally make great efforts to maximize the time and money that their customers spend. Generally, there are no windows or clocks and exits can be difficult to find.
They often offer special food, drink and entertainment promotions to keep guests happy and within the premises.
Some establishments serve free alcoholic drinks. Although drunkenness affects the judgment and every good player knows the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who plans to drive in high latitudes or mountain passes must be prepared for the possibility of snow, ice or low temperatures.
On icy or snow-covered roads, there is little friction, so it is not possible to drive as you do on bare asphalt.
During snowstorms, it can fall so much snow that it traps you in very little time.
Visibility can also be reduced by snow or ice that forms on the windows of a car.
On the other hand, in many countries the conditions of ice and snow are normal and traffic flows almost without interruption throughout the year.
Safaris are probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the most memorable part of many visitors' trips.
The term safari is used to refer to the popular trips to see the amazing wildlife of Africa, particularly in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, will approach vehicles and the standard equipment will provide good visibility.
Sometimes lions, leopards and jaguars can be shy, so you'll have a better chance of seeing them using binoculars.
A walking safari is a type of safari where the participants walk through the bush, rather than being driven in a vehicle.
The Paralympic Games will take place between August 24 and September 5, 2021. A number of events will take place in other parts of Japan.
Host of the 1964 sporting event, Tokyo was the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the announcement of the postponement, there may be complications.
There are different types of travel cancellation policies, but since the end of March, coverage for most of these coronavirus-based policies does not extend until July 2020, which is when the Olympics are scheduled to take place.
It is expected that most of the entries to the events will cost between JPY 2500 and JPY 130 000 and that common passes will cost JPY 7000.

The stirrups are the supports for the riders' feet that hang on both sides of the saddle.
While providing greater stability to the rider, they can present problems of safety, as it is possible that their feet may get caught in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse, but his foot is caught in the stirrup, he can be dragged if the animal runs away. To reduce the risk, there are a series of safety precautions.

Imagine the ski trail as a hiking trail.
In good conditions, it will cover a little longer distances than if it were walked, but very rarely will it reach the speed of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on groomed trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries would mean having to apply for visas and passport controls several times.
