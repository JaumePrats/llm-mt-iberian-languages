In addition to confirming that at least some dinosaurs were plumíferos, a theory that is already generally accepted, also offers specific data that fossils in general do not offer, such as their color and their three-dimensional structure.
According to the experts, this animal has a brownish color on the upper part and a pale or carotene color on the lower part.
Moreover, the discovery allows us to understand better the evolution of the feathers of birds.
Because the plumage of dinosaurs does not have a well-developed axis, called raquis, but it does have other features of feathers (barbs and barbules), the researchers came to the conclusion that the raquis is probably the result of a later evolutionary development of these other features.
The structure of the plumage suggests that its function was not related to flight, but to the regulation of temperature or as an indicator of the same. The researchers maintain that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample analyzed presents features of the plumage of an adult and not of a chick.
The experts' comments were that, although it is a juvenile dinosaur, the sample illustrates more the plumage of an adult than that of a chick.

Although there are reports that indicate that the official number of deaths is eight and the authorities have confirmed that about 30 people were injured, the official figures are still unknown.
Acid cianuric and melamine concentrations were found in the urine samples of animals that died after eating food for pets contaminated.
The researchers indicated that the two compounds react with each other to give rise to crystals that can obstruct renal function.
The specialists detected the formation of crystals in the urine of the felines, by the incorporation of melamine and cyanuric acid.
By comparing the spectra obtained by FTIR, it was possible to determine that the composition of the crystals coincides with the one found in the urine of the affected animals.
I don't know if they have noticed it or not, but the majority of the products coming from Central America arrived to this country free of taxes.
Even so, the Central American countries charged us with eighty percent of the products we manufacture. They treat us.
I thought that was not fair; definitely it was not fair.
The only thing I tell people is that you treat us the way we treat you.
A proposal of law was dictated by the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, who does not allow to sell or rent violent video games to minors.
The bill proposes that video games that are sold in the state of California must be labeled with a sticker with the legend "18" and penalizes their sale to minors with a fine of $1000 for non-compliance.
The Director of the Crown Prosecution Service, Kier Starmer QC, made a statement this morning informing that Huhne and Pryce would be brought to trial.

Schneider gave testimony through a virtual link from a base of the US Air Force in his country of origin.
Carpanedo took part in two individual races of the championship apart from the Wednesday competition.
The first was the slalom, in which he obtained a "Did not finish the first race", as well as 36 of the 116 participants of that race.
In her other career, the giant slalom, she got the tenth place in the female group of sitting with a time of execution combined of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes behind the first Austrian finalist, Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes behind the ninth finalist, Gyöngyi Dani, from Hungary.
Four slalom skiers of the category sitting down did not complete their races and a total of 45 participants of 117 of the Giant Slalom did not reach the classification in the race.
The police force of Madhya Pradesh could recover the laptop and the mobile phone stolen.
The deputy inspector general, D.K. Arya, declared: "We have arrested five individuals who abused the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop computer."
Baba, Bhutha, Rampro, Gaza and Vishnu Kanjar are the accused.
According to the superintendent of police, Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the accused appeared before the court with their faces covered.
Despite the fact that there were three people inside the house at the time of the impact of the car, none of them suffered injuries.
However, the driver suffered serious injuries in his head.
The road where the accident took place was closed temporarily while the emergency services were taking the driver of the Audi TT red car out of the vehicle.
In the beginning, it was transferred to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Then he was transferred to Addenbrooke Hospital, in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been in the Court of the County of Edinburgh, accused of the murder of her son.
While she is under custody awaiting the accusation and the trial, any declaration of an eye-witness can be questioned, since her image has been the object of a wide diffusion.
It is a common practice in other parts of the United Kingdom, but as the Scottish justice system works differently, the courts considered the publication of photographs as potentially prejudicial.
The professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee said: "It seems that journalists walk on dangerous ground when they publish photos or other information about suspects."
The Office of the Crown, which has the responsibility for the processing, indicated to the journalists that they would not make any additional comments until the issuing of the summons.
According to the information that leaked, the document will deal with the border conflict, which Palestine intends to resolve based on the existing limits prior to the Middle East War of 1967.
Other topics that were also addressed, according to information provided, include the future state of Jerusalem, which both nations consider sacred, and the Jordan Valley problem.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after the agreement is signed, while PA only accepts five.
During the complementary control of pests, the guards had to supervise the shooters closely, since this was monitored and evaluated.
In a partnership between NPWS and the NSW Association of Sporting Shooters, volunteers were recruited for the Association's shooting program.
Mick O'Flynn, who is in charge, provisionally, of the Conservation and Heritage Office of the NPWS Park, pointed out that a comprehensive training was provided to the four selected shooters for the operation.
Yesterday, Martelly swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP, for its English acronym) of nine members.
In four years, it's the fifth CEP of Martelly.
Last month, a presidential commission advised that the CEP should resign, in the context of a series of measures that aim to lead the country towards new elections.
The commission was the way in which Martelly responded to the generalized demonstrations that began in October against the regime.
The demonstrations, at times violent, were provoked by the fact that elections are not carried out, in some cases since 2011.
Around 60 cases of iPods with problems of functioning and overheating have been denounced, which has caused six fires and minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) informed that it had registered 27 accidents involving these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company classified as "not serious".
The ministry has spoken out on the delay in the Apple report, saying it was "truly lamentable".
Mariana was shaken by a quake at 7:19 h local time (21:19 h GMT) on Friday.

Moreover, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center informed the absence of tsunami indicators.
In Manila, capital of the Philippines, a former police agent of that country kidnapped a bus and kept hostages tourists who came from Hong Kong.
Rolando Mendoza opened fire with his M16 against the foreign visitors.
Several hostages have been rescued and, until now, it has been confirmed that at least six have died.
The six hostages, including children and the elderly, were freed early.
Later, the photographers occupied the place of an old woman because she needed to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins continued the same path as his father and began to study medicine.
She received training in obstetrics and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
Liggins began his research on premature birth in his free time, while working in the hospital.
His study showed that fetal lung maturation could be accelerated through the administration of a hormone.
Xinhua reported that on Wednesday the investigators of the government managed to recover the flight recorders of the black box.
The companions of Luna also paid tribute to him.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first queen of the Extreme. She died the night of the two moons, something unique, like her. A strong woman"
Dustin Oro in Powder Runnels declared: "Luna was as rare as me; even more. I love her and I miss her. I hope she is in a better place".
Since 2008, among the 1400 people surveyed in advance of the 2010 federal elections, there was an 8% increase in those who oppose Australia becoming a republic.
Julia Gillard, interim prime minister, said during the 2010 federal elections campaign that Australia should become a republic once the reign of Queen Isabel II was over.
34% of the respondents share this vision and want that Isabel II be the last Queen of Australia.
In one end of the survey is located a 29 % of people who consider that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible; in the other, a 31 % who think it should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist in the 100 meters and 200 meters freestyle swimming style had to swim in the 100 meters and 200 meters freestyle swimming style, and in three relays in the Commonwealth Games, but his physical condition has been put in doubt due to his complaints.
He not been able to take painkillers to relieve the pain, because it is prohibited to use them in the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
Many people checked the discovery by using different hardware and software and at the beginning of February and it was known on Tuesday.
It is possible that comets have served as a source of water supply for our planet, as well as organic matter, which has the capacity to form proteins and sustain life.
The scientists' expectation is to understand how planets are formed, in particular our own, since comets have collided with the Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53 years old, took office at the beginning of the year and the month past, signing a law that allows people of the same sex to marry.
He qualified the rumors as "political gossip and boberías".
It is speculated that he will present himself in the presidential elections in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the Federal Aviation Administration, would reduce the distances of air routes, which would save millions of gallons of fuel per year, as well as carbon emissions.
Use satellite technology, in contrast with the old radar technology, in order to allow air traffic controllers to detect aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate data.
There will be no additional transport and the trains will not stop at Wembley. Parking for cars and the deterrent will not be available.
Due to the concern generated by the possible lack of transport, it was considered the possibility of playing the game closed doors, without the fans of the team.
On Thursday, the magazine Science revealed a study that informed about the appearance of a new species of bird in the Galápagos Islands.
Experts from Princeton University, in the U.S., and from Uppsala University, in Sweden, announced that the new species evolved in just two generations, even though it was estimated that it would take much longer, because of the reproduction between a Darwin's endemic pinzón, Geospiza fortis, and a cactus-migrating pinzón, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can take on any shape and be rolled into tiny figures.
It is not only possible to hammer and roll in sheets, but also to stretch it until it achieves a very fine wire that can be twisted and braided.
It can be very thin and adhere to another metal. It is so thin that it can be used to decorate the illustrations made by hand in books called "manuscripts illuminated".
This is called the pH of a chemical substance. You can make a pH indicator using red grape juice.
The colour of the juice of the cabbage will be altered depending on how acid or basic (alkaline) is the chemical substance.
The number of hydrogen ions (H in pH) present in the chemical product analyzed determines its pH level.
Hydrogen atoms are formed by a proton and an electron. Therefore, a hydrogen ion is the result of removing a proton from an electron.
Mix both dry powders together and, after doing it, with the hands cleaned and moistened, form a ball.
A reaction will take place between the moisture in their hands and their external layers, which will feel strange to the touch and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had inodoros with discharge in almost all the houses, which were connected with a sophisticated drainage system.
In some houses of the cities of Minoan Crete and Santorini, Greece, were found traces of sewer systems.
They also had toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In the Roman civilization, public baths had toilets and some were shared by men and women.
When one communicates with someone who is miles away, one is using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and, then, reflects it back almost instantly.
The satellite was sent to space through a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space, because the atmosphere of the Earth distorts part of the light and vision that we have.
We need a giant rocket, more than 100 feet high, to carry a satellite or telescope to space.
The wheel has changed the world in surprising ways. The most relevant thing it has done for us is to make our transport much simpler and faster.
Thanks to her we have many means of transport, like the railway or the car, among many others.
Below, there are medium-sized felines that feed on medium-sized prey, from rabbits to deer and elk.
Finally, there are many small felids (which include domestic cats) that feed on species of small size that exist in much greater abundance, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of his success is the concept of niche: each cat has a particular function, which avoids that it competes with others.
Lions are the big cats that most socialize and their life takes place in large groups called prides.
The herds are formed by one to three adult males of the same family group, united with up to thirty females and their calves.
Usually, the females relate closely to each other, which makes them a great family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides have the same behaviour as wolf packs or dogs, with whom they share a surprising similarity (in contrast to the other large felines) in their behaviour and in that they are highly lethal to their prey.
The tiger has the ability to climb (but not very well), swim, dive, jump five times as far as a strong person and pull five times as much as a strong person.
The tiger belongs to the same genus (Panthera) as the lion, leopard and jaguar. These are the only four big cats capable of roaring.
The roar of the tiger is not a full-bodied roar like that of the lion, but rather a series of words uttered in growls and yells.
Ocelots enjoy eating small creatures. In most cases, they will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Almost all their prey will be smaller than them.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find prey (prey) through smell, smelling the ground where they have passed.
They have very good night vision and in dark and, in addition, they move very quietly. The ocelots hunt their prey mimicking their environment and then they attack them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) moves away from the main one from which it comes (for example, if it moves to a mountain range or a river, or if it moves to a new island so that it cannot go back easily), it will find itself, often, in a different environment to the one it was used to.
The new environment has different resources and competitors, and, therefore, a new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor.
No have been produced changes in the original population, which still need the same adaptations as in the past.
As time goes by, as the population is adapting to the new environment, it begins to look more and more like the other population.
Finally, after millions or even billions of years, the two populations will be so different that it will not be possible to classify them as belonging to the same species.
This process receives the name of speciation, which simply means the development of new species, and is an unavoidable and fundamental consequence of evolution.
Plants generate the oxygen that people breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that they exhale (which they exhale).
The food of plants is generated with solar energy, thanks to photosynthesis. In addition, they offer us shade.
We build our houses with plants and with them we also make clothes. The majority of the food we eat is plants. Without them, animals would not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the alpha predator of its time, so it feared nothing, except for other of its own species.
His long jaws had more than 70 sharp teeth like knives, in addition to another group in the palate, which means that any thing that passed through his mouth, had no escape.
We don't have the security, but it could have had the viperine. Its diet included turtles, big fish, other mosasaurids and, even, it could have been a cannibal.
He also attacked any creature that entered the water: not even a T. Rex as big as the T. Rex was a threat to him.
While most of that food would be quite familiar to us, the Romans also ate some unusual items at banquets, such as wild boar, pheasants, lobsters and even a type of rodent, the lizard.
Another thing that distinguished them was that the poor and women ate sitting down, while the rich enjoyed sharing banquets and eating on the side.
It is not possible that the recipes of the ancient Rome included foods that arrived to Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
In fact, they didn't have maize, nor tomatoes, nor potatoes, nor cacao, nor any Roman of the ancient times tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a temple for each of their gods, which they considered their home.
The people carried sacrifices to the gods and the priests tried to satisfy the needs of those celebrating ceremonies and festivals.
The temples have an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary that only the priests could enter.
In some cases, they built special towers with a pyramidal shape, called ziggurats, to be part of the temples.
The upper part of the tower constituted a special sanctuary for its deity.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was of little importance.
The Jewish families spent the greater part of their time outdoors.
The women cooked in the patio; the shops were only showcases that gave to the street. The houses were built with stone.
In Canaan there were no big forests; for this reason, the wood was very expensive.
Few people lived in Greenland. According to the sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, during a journey that he undertook more westward, he discovered the island and gave it his name.
However, without prejudice to its discovery, the Eskimos already inhabited the place at that time.
While each country was "Scandinavian", there were marked differences in relation to the people, the monarchs, the habits and the history between Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you have seen the film "National Treasure", you may think that a map of the treasure was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. While the reverse of the document contains something written, it is not a map of a treasure.
The Declaration of Independence has written on its reverse the phrase "Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776". The text is on the lower part of the document, below.
Although it is not known for certain who wrote it, it is known that it was only just made, the huge document of parchment (measures 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up to be stored.
Therefore, it is likely that the annotation has been added only as a label.
Although the landings carried out on D-Day, as well as the subsequent confrontations, had achieved the liberation of the north of France, the south was still to be liberated.
His government was in the hands of the Frenchmen of "Vichy", who were a group that, in 1940, had agreed the peace with the Germans and worked with the invaders in place of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, the "Operation Dragon" was launched, through which the Allies invaded the south of France.
In just two weeks, the American and French forces had liberated the south of France and were heading for Germany.
One can define a civilization as a specific culture of a large group of people who live and work together; in other words, a society.
The term civilization derives from the Latin word civilis, which means civil, and relates to the word civis, of the same language, which means citizen, as well as to civitas, which means city or city state and which, in addition, determines in some way the size of the society.
The state cities are the precursors of the nations. A culture of civilization implies a long-lasting transmission of knowledge, a durable cultural legacy and a homogenous propagation.
The minoritariats cultures tenden a desaparecer sin dejar rastros históricos relevantes, i no loguen ser reconocidas com civilizacions propiament dites.
During the War of the Revolution, the thirteen states formed, in the beginning, a central government weak under the Articles of Confederation, in which the Congress was its only component.
The Congress did not have the powers to fix taxes and, given that it had a national executive or judicial power, the function fell to the authorities of the states, which often did not cooperate to make all its laws effective.
He was not empowered to annul fiscal laws or customs duties between states.
The articles demanded the unanimous approval of all the states to proceed to their amendment and the states gave so little importance to the central government that their representatives often absented themselves.
The Italian national football team, together with the German selection, is the second team with more victories in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among the sports that are most practiced are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, figure skating and Formula 1.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern regions, with athletes who participate in international tournaments and Olympic Games.
In Japan there are about 7000 islands (the largest one is Honshu), which makes it the seventh largest archipelago in the world.
Due to the conglomerate/group of islands that it contains, it is usually referred to Japan as an "archipelago", from a geographical point of view.
The history of Taiwan dates from the 15th century, when the sailors of Europe who sailed through the place registered the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, which means Beautiful Island.
The establishment, in 1624, by the Dutch East India Company, of a base in the southwest of Taiwan, gave rise to a transformation in the aboriginal method of grain production, with the employment of Chinese labour to work in its plantations of rice and sugar.
The Qing army took control of the coastal region of northern Taiwan in 1683 and declared it a dependent province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after having been defeated during the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, through which it ceded the sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which kept control over the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu counts with three main constructions: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Three Windows.
The majority of the buildings have been reconstructed at the ends of the complex in order to let the tourists see how they looked originally.
By 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu had been restored and the works are still continuing.
To illustrate, the most common format for fixed-image photography at the global level is 35 mm, which was the most used film size towards the end of the era of the analog films.
Today, it is still produced, but the most important thing is that the relationship between the dimensions is transferred to the sensors of digital cameras.
In truth, the 35 mm format is somewhat confusing, since its measurements are 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
This is why it is said that the dimensional relation of this format (dividing by twelve to calculate the simplest ratio of integers) is equivalent to 3:2.
Many typical formats (for example, the APS group) are similar or very similar to this relation of aspect.
The rule of thirds, which has been the object of constant ridicule and many times mocked, is a simple rule that generates dynamism at the same time that it allows to give a certain order to the images.
Indicates that the most effective position to place the central object is the intersection formed by the horizontal and vertical lines that divide the image into thirds (see example).
During this phase of the history of Europe, the Catholic Church, which had accumulated wealth and power, was questioned.
For more than a millennium, Christianity had succeeded in uniting the European states despite their different languages and customs.
His power, present everywhere, affected all, from the monarch to the plebe.
One of the most important principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the funds of the church are reserved for that specific function.
The central cupola of the church had remained in Rome for more than a thousand years and this concentration of power and money made many wonder if this principle was being respected.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, the British began a naval blockade of Germany.
While the strategy, which involved the interruption of military and civil vital supplies, was successful, such a measure violated the generally recognized and contemplated international right in several international agreements of the last two centuries.
Britain extracted international waters in complete sectors of the ocean to block the entry of ships, putting at risk, even, neutral ships.
Having received a reduced answer to this tactic, Germany thought it would meet a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the attitude adopted by the majority of citizens and nations was that of pacifism and isolation.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities that occurred during the First World War, the countries wanted to avoid that such a situation would repeat itself in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the U.S. with 4 cents, a book of poems and a recommendation letter written by Charles Batchelor (his manager in his last job) and addressed to Thomas Edison.
The ancient China had a unique way of delimiting the different periods of time. Each dynasty or each family in power constituted a different dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there was also a period of instability, with provinces divided. The most known was the Three Kingdoms, which developed for 60 years, between the Hhan and Jin dynasties.
During these stages, a cruel war broke out between many nobles who disputed the throne.
One of the bloodiest periods of the history of Ancient China was the Three Kingdoms, where thousands of people died in a fight for the throne of the great palace in Xi'an.
There are many political and social consequences, such as the use of the metric system, the displacement of absolutism towards republicanism, nationalism and the conviction that the country belongs to the people, and not to a single sovereign.
Likewise, after the Revolution, the posts were open to all male candidates, which allowed the success of the most ambitious and prestigious.
The same happens with the military, since, instead of basing the charges of the army on classes, now they are based on the caliber.
The French Revolution was also a source of inspiration for many other people of the working class repressed in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Mahoma was deeply interested in matters beyond this earthly life. He used to visit a cave that was known as "Hira" in the mountain of "Noor" (light) to reflect.
The cave itself, which has survived in time, illustrates very realistically the spiritual inclinations of Mohammed.
On the top of one of the mountains north of La Meca, and in the middle of nowhere, lies a cave totally isolated from the rest of the planet.
In fact, it is very difficult to find, even if one were sure of its existence. Inside the cave, isolation is total.
Nothing can be seen but the wonderful clear sky and the numerous mountains of the surroundings. From the inside of this cave, one can see and hear very little of this world.
Of the seven wonders, the only one that still stands is the Great Pyramid of Guiza.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptian people in the 3rd century BC, is one of the many pyramids of the same shape and size built to worship the deceased pharaoh.
The Guiza Plateau, or "Necropolis of Guiza", in the Valley of the Dead, in Egypt, contains numerous pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of the Pharaoh Khufu, and many others of this type, tombs and temples of smaller size were built in honor to his wives and relatives.
The "arc upwards" mark is similar to a V and the "arc downwards" mark is similar to a grap or a square without its lower border.
Up means that you have to start at the tip and push the bow, and down means that you have to start at the frog, where the hand holds the bow, and pull it.
The ascending arc generates a softer sound, while the descending arc is more forceful and abrupt.
Feel free to make your own marks with pencil, but don't forget that the marks on the bow have been printed in that place for a musical purpose and, therefore, should be respected.
On October 6, 1789, a crowd of women from the market forced the terrified King Louis XVI, his wife Marie Antoinette, their two small children (Maria Teresa, 11 years old, and Luis Carlos, 4 years old), and his sister, Madam Elizabeth, to return to Paris from Versailles.
They returned to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd that shouted and threw threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriage completely.
At some point, a participant of the revolt shook the head of a guard executed in Versailles in front of the queen, who was in panic.
The Filipino people themselves paid the war expenses of the imperialism of the United States in the conquest of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States with the purpose of paying the majority of the expenses and interests of the bonds that fluctuated in the name of the Filipino government in the banks of Wall Street.
Already, the super profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the main profits of the American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context that gave rise to the establishment of the order.
The historical period in Europe in which these events take place is known as the Middle Ages, between the 11th and 13th centuries (that is, between 1000 and 1300).
The Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which, by convention, ends around 1500.
The technological determinism is a concept that comprehends, pragmatically, a great range of ideas, from the impulse or technological imperative until a strict sense of that there is a subyacente logic that pushes the destiny of the humanity and that it relates with the laws of science and how they are reflected in the technology.
Almost all interpretations of the technological determinism have in common two general ideas: that the technological development itself unfolds on an independent path from any cultural or political influence, and that, at the same time, technology has "effects" in the societies that are inherent and not socially conditioned.
For example, one could argue that the existence of cars necessarily implies the development of roads.
However, a national network of roads is not viable economically for a reduced number of cars, so new techniques of manufacturing are being designed to reduce the costs of owning a car.
The widespread use of cars also generates a greater incidence of traffic accidents, which leads to the development of new techniques in the field of health to repair the damaged bodies.
The determinism of the cultural element was very present in the romanticism, according to studies like Goether, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the Romantic context, geography moulded people and, with the passing of time, developed customs and cultures related to that geography that, being in harmony with the location of that society, were preferable to laws imposed arbitrarily.
As Paris is known as the city of fashion in the present day, Constantinople was considered as such in the feudal Europe.
His fame of being epicenter of luxury began approximately in 400 BC and extended until approximately 1100 AD.
During the twelfth century its status decayed, especially due to the fact that, on their return, the Crusaders brought gifts, such as silks and spices, which were valued more than the goods offered in the Byzantine markets.
The title of "Capital of Fashion" was transferred, from then on, from Constantinople to Paris.
The peak of the Gothic style took place in the period between the X-XI and the XIV centuries.
In the beginning, the way of dressing received a great influence from the Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to the slowness of the communication channels, the western styles could be delayed by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe started to develop its own style. One of the most significant advances of that time was that, as a result of the Crusades, people started to use buttons to fasten their clothes.
Agriculture of subsistence is understood as that whose objective is to produce sufficient food to feed only the needs of the farmer and his family.
The subsistence farming is a simple practice, usually organic, that combines the use of stored seeds from the region with the rotation of crops and other comparatively simple methods to maximize production.
Historically, a large part of the main activity of the farmers was subsistence farming, which is still practiced in many countries in the way of development.
Subcultures gather individuals with similar ideas and feelings of marginality due to the social standards and gives them the possibility to generate a sense of identity.
There are many factors that can distinguish subcultures: age, ethnicity, class, location or gender of their members.
The characteristics that distinguish a subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, sexual, geographical or related to religion or politics, or a mixture of factors.
It is common that the members of a subculture exhibit traits of their belonging to this resorting to the distinctive and symbolic use of style, as the fashion, gestures and jargon.
One of the most commonly used mechanisms to graph the importance of socializing is to analyze the few and lamentable cases of children who, by negligence, bad luck or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults during their growth.
These children are called "wild". Some wild children are confined by people, in general their parents. In some cases, the abandonment of a child is due to the rejection of the parents of the child with a severe intellectual or physical disability.
It is possible that the wild children have suffered traumatic situations or severe child abuse before being abandoned or fleeing.
It is said that others were raised by animals and that some have lived by themselves in the wild.
When the wild child is raised exclusively by animals different from humans, it presents behaviors (within its physical possibilities) almost equal to those of the animal that took care of it, as well as its fear or indifference towards people.
Although the learning based on projects should facilitate this process and make it more interesting, the scaffolding goes a little further.
The scaffolding is not a learning technique; it is, on the contrary, a support that provides assistance to those who are facing a new experience, as the use of a new information technology program or the beginning of a new project.
The scaffolding can be presented in real or virtual format; to put it another way, a teacher is a type of scaffolding, but also it is the animated small subject of Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are incorporated into the software and their function is to question, stimulate or explain procedures that may have been complex for the student to understand by himself.
Children are welcomed into foster homes for a wide variety of reasons, from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should have to grow up in an environment where there is no love, care and education; but it happens.
We can perceive that the family reception system provides a safe environment for these children.
The objective of our system of child care is to offer safe homes, loving foster parents, sustained education and reliable medical assistance.
The objective of the family reception is to cover all the needs that were not met in the home of origin with previous reception.
The Internet is a mixture of components of mass communication and between people.
The different traits that the Internet presents open up new dimensions from the perspective of the concept of uses and rewards.
For example, the "learning" and "socialization" are mentioned as significant incentives for the use of the Internet (James et al., 1995).
During a study of the reactions of the users to the web sites conducted by Eighmey and McCord (1998), the "personal participation" and the "durable relations" were also detected as new motivational factors.
Through the recording of videos, important findings have been made in the interpretation of microexpressions, which are movements in the face lasting only a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is claimed that, through the adequate reading of its microexpressions, it is possible to detect if a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, explained the way in which those who cannot understand speech due to a brain injury can, nevertheless, evaluate the sincerity of the speaker.
It also suggests that the skills to interpret human behavior can be shared with animals, such as domestic dogs.
Through the research works of the XX century it has been demonstrated that there are two types of genetic variation: the hidden and the manifest.
The process of mutation incorporates a new genetic variation; the process of selection removes it from that set of variations.
The segregation and recombination of genes shuffle the variation between one generation and the next.
In the savannah, it is not easy for a primate, whose digestive system is similar to that of humans, to satisfy its amino acid needs with the vegetable resources available to it.
Doing it is even worse: it causes serious problems: slowing down of growth, malnutrition and, in the end, death.
The proteins present in the leaves and legumes would have been the source of the most accessible vegetable resources, but they are not easily digestible for primates like us, except if they are cooked.
On the other hand, the food derived from animals (ants, termites, eggs) is easy to digest and provides a large number of proteins that contain all the essential amino acids.
In the end, we should not be surprised if our own predecessors solved their "protein problems" in the same way that chimpanzees do in the savannah today.
The interruption of sleep consists in waking up intentionally during the normal sleep period and sleeping again after a short time (10 to 60 minutes).
This can be achieved easily with a clock alarm that makes him return to a conscious state, although without waking him completely.
The registration is an additional requirement for the visa process. In some countries, you will have to register your presence and the address of your accommodation with the local authorities.
Other options that are based on the biological rhythm are to drink a lot of liquid (especially water or tea, known diuretic) before going to bed, which will oblige him to get up to urinate.
The level of inner peace that a person enjoys is related to the amount of tension that is present in his body and in his spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive is the force of life with which we are. Each one of us has the potential to find absolute peace and happiness.
We can all reach enlightenment. The only thing that blocks the way is our tension and negativity.
While the bases of the Tibetan Buddhism are the teachings of Buddha, they extended by the path of the love Mahayana and numerous techniques of the yoga of India.
In general terms, laísmo is very simple. It is based on the kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of love that encompasses everything.
In Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (illumination) is activated with yoga postures, breathing practices, mantras or visualization.
Tibetan meditation focuses on the Devata Yoga. Through the visualization of different deities, the energy channels can be unblocked, the chakras can be activated and the consciousness of enlightenment can be developed.
The cooperation between the USSR and the USA was the result of facing a common enemy, Germany, during the Second World War. When the war ended, the clashes of system, process and culture ended up distancing the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It would last for 40 years and it would be fought in earnest, through substitute militias, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, among many other places.
Because on September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken, its only hope was to retreat and reorganize itself in the extension of the Romanian head of bridge.
However, these plans fell into disuse almost overnight, when more than 800,000 Red Army soldiers from the Soviet Union entered and formed the fronts of Belarus and Ukraine after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other bilateral, multilateral and international agreements.
Using ships to transport goods is a much more efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across the oceans.
Since always, the function of the navy has been to guarantee that its country can move its population and goods, at the same time that it interferes with the enemy's capacity to do the same.
The Atlantic Campaign in the Second World War offers one of the clearest and most recent examples of this. The Americans were trying to transport men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean with the aim of supporting Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly submarines, was trying to stop this circulation.
If the Allies had not been successful, Germany could have taken power in Britain, as it did with the other European countries.
It seems that the goats were domesticated for the first time, about 10 000 years ago, in the Zagros Mountains, in Iran.
With the purpose of obtaining easily their milk, hair, meat and skin, the ancient peoples and tribes started to keep them.
Domestic goats were usually gathered in herds that wandered the hills or other areas of pasturage, often tended by herdsmen who were usually children or teenagers, similar to the most popular shepherd. These methods of pasturage are still used today.
In England, the railway tracks had been installed in the 16th century.
Although the rails of the carts were made of simple parallel planks of wood, they allowed the horses pulling them to achieve a greater speed and to carry heavier loads than on the slightly more rugged roads of the day.
The incorporation of sleepers to keep the rails in their place was carried out quite early. However, gradually, it was realized that the rails would be more efficient if they were covered with iron on their upper part.
This became a habitual practice, although the iron caused a greater wear on the wheels of the wagons, made of wood.
Eventually, the wooden wheels were replaced with iron ones and, in 1767, the first iron rails were used.
The first way of transport was walking. The human being began to do it in an upright position two million years ago with the appearance of the Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
The Australopithecus ancestors did not have the habit of walking erect.
While bipedal tracks have been found in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, it is possible that Sahelanthropus walked on two legs 7 million years ago.
We can start to live a more friendly life with the planet, join environmentalist movements or, even, we can become activists and fight to reduce, in some way, the suffering of the future.
Yes, in many cases, as the asintomatic treatment. But if we are not looking for a temporary situation, we should find the root of the problems and try to deactivate them.
It is obvious that the world has undergone great changes, as a result of the technological and scientific advances of humanity, and the problems have intensified due to the overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of people.
After being approved by the Congress on July 4, 1776, the draft was sent by hand and signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and the Secretary, Charles Thomson, to the printer John Dunlap, who lived a few blocks away.
Copies were made, during the night, between 150 and 200, which are now known as the "Dunlap Copies".
It was John Nixon who read the document for the first time and did it in the patio of the Independence Hall, on July 8.
On July 6th, a copy was sent to George Washington, who ordered that it be read to his army in New York on July 9th. On August 10th, another copy arrived in London.
The 25 photographs of Dunlap, which are known to still exist, are the oldest copies of the document. The original manuscript has been lost.
A large number of paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive today. They are birds.
Many people do not represent them as dinosaurs, since they have feathers and can fly.
However, there are many characteristics in birds that still make them similar to dinosaurs.
They have scaly limbs and claws, lay eggs and move on their hind legs like the T-Rex.
Currently, almost all computers work with data coded under the binary system.
A binary number can only have two values, they are 0 and 1, and, according to the computer jargon, these numbers are known as binary digits, or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be evident immediately. Its symptoms, such as vomiting, are too common to be able to give an immediate diagnosis.
The clearest indicator of internal poisoning can be found with an open bottle of medicines or cleaning products containing toxic chemicals.
Read the label to get information about the specific first aid for that specific poison.
Entomologists use the term parasite insect in a formal sense to refer to this group of arthropods.
The word comes from its ancient relationship with the lice, a species very developed to parasitize humans.
The bedbugs and the bedbugs are nidicolous; they are adapted to inhabit the nest or home of their host.
The cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) registered in the United States are about 400 000, which makes it the most frequent neurological disease among adults young and middle-aged.
The central nervous system, the union of the brain, the spinal cord and the optic nerve, is the object of attack of the multiple sclerosis.
The studies indicate that women have twice the chances of men to suffer from EM.
A couple could conclude that raising a child would not be the most convenient thing for them or for the child.
These couples could choose to plan the adoption of a baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents renounce their parental rights so that a different couple can take care of the child.
The main objective of science is to decipher the way in which the world works through the scientific method. In fact, this method serves as a guide for the vast majority of scientific investigations.
It is not a test, however, it is a test that is used to discard one or more of the possible hypotheses, making questions and observations that guide the scientific research.
The focus of naturalists and philosophers was put on the classical works; especially, on the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle's thoughts, especially those of the science, were accepted.
As the Greek language was declining, Western civilization distanced itself from its Greek roots both philosophically and scientifically.
Frequently, many rhythms present in physiological processes and in the behaviour depend decisively on internal cycles and their production through biological clocks.
The periodic rhythms, which are not only related to external stimuli, have been registered in almost all living beings, even in bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks oscillate in a self-sustaining way and have a free-running period, even if there are no external stimuli.
One of the key indicators that DNA was a genetic material was the experiment conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase inserted their own DNA into a bacterium using fagos, or viruses.
They performed two experiments in which they marked the DNA of the fungus with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the DNA with radioactive sulfur.
Depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected genetic fragment and if it involves germ cells, the mutation can have various effects.
Only mutations in germinal cells can be transmitted to children, while mutations in other parts can cause cellular death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism usually attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, which includes wild animal and plant life.
Some examples of possible activities in the place are: hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visiting parks, and study of information about the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, taking pictures and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in their cars to go to their jobs and they often cross with others whose jobs are in the place from which they just left.
In this dynamic transfer launcher, everyone is somehow connected with a transport system based on the use of private cars, and supports it.
Currently, scientists support that this mass economy of carbon has deprived the biosphere of one of its regular states that has contributed to the evolution of humanity for the last two million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses the transport systems; and almost everyone complains about them.
In developed countries, it is not common to hear similar complaints about water quality or bridge collapse.
What is the reason for the complaints of such a magnitude and why do they happen daily? Are the transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is there something more substantial happening?
Traffic flow is the study of the individual movement of drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them.
Unfortunately, it is not an easy task to study the flow of traffic, since it is not possible to make exact predictions about the behavior of the drivers.
Fortunately, there is a tendency in drivers to maintain a relatively consistent behavior, which allows traffic flows to have a logical consistency and to be represented approximately by mathematical models.
In order to graphically clarify the circulation flow, three important relations were established: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relations facilitate the planning and design of the road network as well as the operations of the road network devices.
The first species to fly were insects. This helped them to evade their enemies more easily and to find food and mate more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back, sticking them to the sides of the body.
This provides a greater range of possible hiding places for small animals.
Currently, the only insects that are unable to fold their wings are the anisoptera and the ephemeroptera.
Millennia ago, a man called Aristarco commented that the Solar System revolved around the Sun.
There were those who shared his theory, but many others believed the opposite: that the solar system orbited the Earth, even the Sun and other stars.
This seems to make sense, since in the Earth we do not perceive its movement, ¿correct?
The Amazon River is the most caudalous and the second most extensive river in the planet. It contains 8 times more water than the river that follows it in size.
In addition, the Amazonas is the widest river in the world, in some points with a width of up to six miles.
Of the total water that comes from the rivers of the world that flows into the oceans, the Amazon River contributes 20 percent.
The Amazon River has a length of 6387 km (3980 miles) and receives water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the pyramids of stone continued to be built until the end of the Ancient Kingdom, they never surpassed the Guiza pyramids, nor in size nor in the sublime technique of their construction.
The ancient Egyptian city of the New Empire was amazed by the monuments of its ancestors, which dated back more than a thousand years.
With approximately 800 inhabitants, the Vatican City is the smallest independent country in the world and the least populated.
Italian is used in the Vatican City, both for drafting its normative texts and for issuing its official communiqués.
The language that is spoken daily by the majority of those who work in the state is also Italian and the use of Latin is generally reserved for religious ceremonies.
All the citizens who live in the Vatican City are Catholics.
The basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper are known since antiquity, since they can be found in their original form in nature and are relatively easy to extract with rudimentary tools.
Aristotle developed the theory that everything is formed by a combination of one or several of four elements: earth, water, air and fire.
It had a greater resemblance with the states of matter (with the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, but, at the same time, it had the theory that they transform into new substances that form the things that we see.
Alloys are, basically, a combination of two or more metals. Remember that the periodic table has many elements.
Metals are considered the elements like calcium and potassium. From now on, there are metals of the type of gold and silver.
It is also possible that there are alloys with small amounts of carbon, which are not metallic.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter, composed of small particles called atoms.
The size of the atoms is so impressively small that the end of this sentence could contain billions of them.
For this reason, when it was invented, the pencil gained many friends.
Unfortunately, the implementation of new writing methods has led to the use of the pencil less and has lost its status.
Today, people write messages on their computers' screens. They don't even need to approach a pencil.
The only thing left to ask is what will happen to the keyboard when something newer comes along.
The atomic bomb operates on the principle that it requires energy to form a nucleus with a large number of protons and neutrons.
It is similar to what happens when a heavy cart rolls down a hill. Dividing the nucleus once more, it frees part of that energy.
Some atoms' nuclei are unstable, that is, they tend to decompose with a minimum or almost no push.
The surface of the moon is composed of rocks and dust and its outer shell is called crust.
The bark has a thickness of about 70 km in the near side and of 100 km in the far side.
It is thinner under the lunar seas and thicker under the highlands.
It is possible that there are more lakes in the side closer to the volcano, due to the fact that its crust is thinner, which facilitated the lava to rise to the surface.
Theories of content are focused on finding out what attracts or pleases people.
These doctrines maintain that people have certain needs or desires that have been internalized as they grew up until they reached maturity.
These theories analyze what causes that certain people want the things they do and what factors of their environment oblige them to do or not certain things.
Two very known theories are the hierarchy of needs, of Maslow, and the two factors, of Hertzberg.
In general, there are two types of behavior when managers begin to lead their former colleagues. On one side of the spectrum, there is the attempt to continue being "one of the boys" (or girls).
To managers of this category it is difficult to take decisions that are not well received by employees, impose disciplinary measures, carry out performance evaluations, assign responsibilities and demand accountability from the staff.
On the other end of the spectrum, it mutates into a person who believes it is necessary to modify everything that has been done until now by the group and do it in its own way.
In the end, the final responsible for the success and failure of the team is the leader.
This way of behaving many times ends up distancing the leaders from the rest of the team members.
The same excellence standards that apply to conventional teams apply to virtual teams, although there are small differences.
Often, the members of a virtual team act as a point of contact for their physical closest group.
Generally, they enjoy greater autonomy than the members of a traditional group, thanks to the possibility of their teams to meet at different times, which, for example, could not be understood by the local management.
The existence of an "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) constitutes also an exclusive element of the virtual teams.
The "invisible team" is the group in charge of managing and to which each member reports. It is the one that fixes the standards for each member.
What motive could there be for an organization to submit to the process of establishing an organization of learning? One of the purposes of applying the theoretical concepts of organizational learning is to promote innovation.
When all the available resources are used in an appropriate way in the operational departments of an organization, there is space for creativity and ingenuity.
As a result of this, it is possible that the process of an organization that works in team to overcome a difficulty of place to a new innovative process to attend the needs of the customers.
For an organization to be innovative, the leadership must first generate a culture of innovation, as well as a shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuous approach as a method used to help organizations to achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data offer factual evidence for a theoretical approach to the research of cognition. They reduce the field of research and confer greater accuracy.
The existing correlation between the cerebral pathology and the behavior contributes to the research of the scientists.
For a long time it has been known that various types of brain damage, traumas, lesions and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in mental functions.
Thanks to the apogeo of new technologies, we have the possibility to see and investigate structures and processes that take place in the brain that have never been seen before.
This provides us with abundant information and material to develop simulation models, which help us to understand the mental processes.
Although artificial intelligence is often associated with science fiction, it is a speciality of great relevance within computer science, which is responsible for the behaviour, learning and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
The research in the field of AI implies the development of machines in order to automate tasks that require an intelligent behavior.
Examples of this are, among others, monitoring, planning and programming, the ability to respond to diagnostic and consultation requests from customers, as well as facial recognition, handwriting recognition, voice recognition.
These issues have become separate disciplines, focused on offering solutions to problems of real life.
The Artificial Intelligence System is used now often in the sectors of the economy, medicine, engineering and military, in the same way as it was incorporated in various applications of video games and personal computers.
Study trips are an important part of any class. It is very common for a teacher to want to take her students to places that are not accessible by bus.
The solution comes from the hand of technology, through virtual excursions. Students can observe the objects exhibited in a museum, visit an aquarium or contemplate beautiful works of art sitting with their class.
Sharing a virtual excursion is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, the students of the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the capital of the state and each year the website is updated, but the previous versions are kept online as an album of memories.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing. Even though students often start their blogging experience with a grammar and spelling that are not very careful, this usually changes when they have an audience.
Because students are the readers who most criticize, the writer of blogs starts to try to improve his writing, in order to avoid the criticisms.
Moreover, the blog requires that students be more understanding of the world around them. The need to arouse the interest of the audience inspires them to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a resource that inspire collaboration and encourage students to deepen their learning beyond the typical school day.
The appropriate use of blogs "can empower students to be more analytical and critical, through the active response to the contents of the Internet, they can define their positions in the context of the writings of others, and establish their perspectives on specific topics» (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the captivating bilingual capital of Canada and it has a variety of museums and galleries that exhibit the history and the present of the country.
The Niagara Falls are located more south and the north hosts the natural beauty without exploiting it of Muskoka and the extension that follows.
These aspects, among others, are those that highlight Ontario as intrinsically Canadian to the eyes of foreigners.
The largest areas towards the north are little populated and some are wild lands, almost uninhabited.
To make a comparison of the population that causes great surprise to many: in the United States there are more afroamericanos than canadians.
The location of the islands of East Africa is in front of the eastern coast of that continent, in the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar is, by far, the largest and a continent in itself if we talk about wild life.
The majority of the smallest islands are independent or associated with France and are popular for their beaches and luxury tourist complexes.
Islam was also brought to the lands by the Arabs and it was imposed, in a large measure, in the Comoros and Mayotte.
The first European and colonial influence took place in the 15th century, as a result of the discovery, by the Portuguese explorer, Vasco da Gama, of the route that unites the Cape of Good Hope with India.
The region borders with the Sahel to the north, and with the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that all female visitors say they are married, regardless of their real marital status.
It will also be useful to use a ring (just make sure it doesn't look too expensive).
Women must be aware that cultural differences can provoke what they consider harassment, and that it is not uncommon that they are followed, taken by the arm, etc.
Be round to reject men and not to fear to defend your position (exist differences culturales or not, that is not correct!).
The founders of the modern city of Casablanca were the Berber fishermen during the 10th century BC and the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids used it as a strategic port, called Anfa.
It was destroyed and rebuilt by the Portuguese with the name of Casa Branca, but in 1755 it was abandoned after the occurrence of an earthquake.
The city was rebuilt by order of the Moroccan sultan with the name of Daru l-Badya and the Spanish traders who installed their businesses in that place called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the most boring places to go shopping in Morocco.
In the surroundings of the old Medina, there are many places where you can buy traditional Moroccan articles, such as earthenware pots, ceramics, leather products, water pipes and a whole range of trinkets, although everything is prepared for tourists.
Goma is a tourist point of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, on the eastern border, near Rwanda.
In 2002, the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma and left a large part of its streets submerged, especially in the city center.
While Goma is quite safe, any visit to the outside must be considered in order to take knowledge of the situation of the confrontations that persist in the province of Kivu of the North.
The city is the base to climb the Nyiragongo volcano and its gorilla trekking excursions are the most economical in Africa.
To move inside Goma, you can opt for a boda-boda (mototaxi). The regular tariff (local) is CDF500 (Congolese francs) for a short trip.
And, on top of that, it is relatively inaccessible, it has given "Tombuctú" an exotic and distant image.
Tombuctú is a poor city today, but it still has an airport and its reputation makes it a tourist attraction.
In 1990, it was included in the World Heritage List in danger, due to the threat of the sands of the desert.
It was one of the most important stops of the special Maravillas del mundo africano, by Henry Louis Gates, on PBS.
The city contrasts much with the rest of the country, since it has a more Arab style than African.
The Kruger National Park (PNK) is located in the northeast of South Africa and extends along the border with Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north and the Crocodile River in the south.
The park has a surface of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 ecozones, in each of which a different wild life develops.
This is one of the most important attractions in South Africa and is recognized as the main icon of the National Parks of South Africa (SANParks).
As in all the natural reserves of South Africa, there are daily rates for conservation and access to the park.
It is also convenient to buy a Wild Card that allows entry to selected parks in South Africa or to all the National Parks of the country.
The territory of Hong Kong takes the name of the island homonymous, which is the destination of most tourists consider the main attraction.
The comparison of the buildings that delimit the horizon of Hong Kong with a luminous bar graph that is evident by the presence of the waters of the Victoria Harbour.
The best way to enjoy the best views of Hong Kong is to leave the island and go to the Kowloon side, located in front.
The reclaimed land of the northern coast of Hong Kong is where the city's urban development is concentrated.
This is the site that the British conquerors adopted as their own. For this reason, if you want to see proofs of the colonial past of this region, it is a convenient place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove forest in the world, with a length of 80 km (50 miles) from the coast towards the interior of Bangladesh and India.
The UNESCO has declared the Sundarbans a World Heritage Site. The section of the forest within the Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not only mangroves, but also have some of the last trees that remain of the imposing jungles that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans comprises an area of 3850 km2 and about a third of its extension is covered by water or swampy areas.
The Sundarbans have been, since 1966, a temple of the wild life and it is estimated that in the current area there are 400 tigers reales of Bengal and 30 000 spotted deer.
The buses leave from the bus station between districts (on the other side of the river) all day, although the majority, especially those that travel to the east and to Jakar (also called Bumthang), leave between 6:30 and 7:30 a.m.
Because buses between districts are usually full of passengers, it is advisable to buy a ticket in advance.
Almost all districts have the Coaster buses, which are comfortable and resistant.
Sharing a taxi ride is a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (150 ngultrums) and Punakha (200 ngultrums).
The Oyapock Bridge is a cantilever bridge that crosses the river, connecting Oiapoque, Brazilian city, and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, in Guayana Francesa.
The two towers reach a height of 83 m, with a length of 378 m and two lanes of 3.5 m of width.
Below the bridge there is a free space of 15 meters and, although its construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened for traffic until March 2017.
The full functioning of the bridge is estimated for September 2017, which is when it is expected that the Brazilian customs controls will end.
The area that currently constitutes the east of Paraguay was inhabited by the guaraníes, who were the indigenous group most important in that region and who lived as nomadic hunters, in addition to practicing subsistence agriculture.
The region of the Chaco also hosted other aboriginal groups, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who hunted, gathered and fished as a means of subsistence.
Paraguay, formerly known as "The giant province of the Indies", was born in the 16th century, as a result of the encounter between the Spanish conquerors and the native peoples.
The Spaniards started the stage of colonization, which lasted for three centuries.
Since Asunción was established, in 1537, Paraguay has been able to conserve a good part of its aboriginal identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best teams and the best players in the world.
The most important polo tournament of the year takes place in December in the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
They can also watch other tournaments and matches of lower level in other parts of the year.
On the Association Argentina de Polo website you will find information about the tournaments and where to buy tickets for the polo matches.
The value of the pound sterling (FKP), the official currency of the Falkland Islands, is fixed in relation to the British pound (GBP).
There is only one bank in the islands. There you can change your money. It is in front of the FIC West shop, in Stanley.
Sterling is accepted in most places in the islands. In Stanley, you can also pay with credit cards or US dollars.
There are chances that in the periphery islands they do not accept credit cards, but they could use British or American money. Ask in advance to the owners to be able to define which is the accepted payment method.
It is practically impossible to change money outside the Malvinas Islands, so it is advisable to do it before leaving.
Because Montevideo is located south of Ecuador, there it is summer when in the northern hemisphere is winter and viceversa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics, with frequent temperatures above +30° C during the summer.
Winter cold can be deceptive: although it is very rare that temperatures are below the freezing point, wind and humidity interact to make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no "rainy" or "dry" stations; the amount of rain is almost the same all year.
Although many animals of the park are accustomed to seeing people, wild life is not tame, so that it is not necessary to feed it nor to disturb it.
According to the indications of the authorities of the parks, it is necessary to maintain a minimum distance of 100 yards/meters from the bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters from the rest of the wild animals.
Although they may appear very gentle, the truth is that bears, bison, deer, moose and practically all large animals can be aggressive.
Hundreds of visitors suffer injuries every year because they do not maintain a safe distance. These animals are big, wild and potentially wild; therefore, respect their space.
Moreover, remember that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so it should avoid having or cooking food that release a lot of smell and keep the camp clean.
The capital of Samoa, Apia is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of about 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and is the capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, the port was the scene of a disastrous naval confrontation when seven German, American and English ships refused to leave the port.
They sank all the ships, except for a British cruiser. They killed about two hundred Americans and Germans.
During the war for independence that Mau's movement faced, a peaceful encounter in the city had as a result the assassination of the state's chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.

If a rider is thrown from a horse, but has one foot caught in the stirrup, he can be dragged if the animal runs away. To reduce the risk, there are a series of safety measures.
First of all, most of the riders use boots with a narrow heel and a sole that is ready to ride.
In addition, there are saddles, especially the English ones, with safety bars that allow the leather of the stirrup to be detached from its structure if a rider who falls off pulls back.
