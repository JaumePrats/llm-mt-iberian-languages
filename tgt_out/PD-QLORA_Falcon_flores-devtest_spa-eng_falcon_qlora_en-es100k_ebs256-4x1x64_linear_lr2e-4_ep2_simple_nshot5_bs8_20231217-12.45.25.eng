In addition to confirming that at least some dinosaurs were feathered, a widely accepted theory, it also provides specific data that fossils do not, such as their colour and three-dimensional structure.
According to experts, this bird has a brownish upper plumage and a pale or carotenoid lower plumage.
The finding also helps to better understand the evolution of bird feathers.
Since the dinosaur plumage lacks a well-developed keel bone, called a raxis, but does have other feather features (hairs and quills), researchers concluded that the raxis is likely the result of a later evolutionary development of these other feather features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that their function was not related to flight, but rather to temperature regulation or as an indicator of the same. The researchers maintain that, although the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample analyzed shows the plumage of an adult and not a hatchling.
The expert opinions were that, although the tail of a young dinosaur was on display, it illustrated more the plumage of an adult than that of a chick.
Yesterday morning, a car bomb in Gaziantep, Turkey, killed two police officers and wounded more than twenty others.

While the program was primarily theoretical, it was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The tidal forces between the dark matter in the galaxy and the Milky Way would be the forces that would produce the effect expected by the group of scientists.
The Milky Way influences the galaxy of Sagittarius in the same way that the moon exerts a gravitational pull on our planet and causes tides.
Experts concluded that dark matter interacts with regular matter in the same way as regular matter.
This theory holds that most of the dark matter surrounding a galaxy is in the form of a halo and consists of numerous small particles.

Extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) was first detected by Dr. Tony Moll in South African Zululand.
During an interview, he noted that the new variant "causes much concern and alarm, given its high mortality rate."
Dr. Moll believes that some patients may have contracted the virus inside the hospital and at least two of the infected were health workers at that hospital.
In a year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 people with whom he or she has had close contact.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the total TB group still appears to be low: 6 000 of 333 000 individuals infected at a particular point in time in South Africa.

The authorities have also guaranteed several million vials of the vaccine to fight encephalitis, which will allow health companies to prepare for the next year.

In France, elections have traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters go into a booth and insert a pre-printed ballot indicating the candidate they have chosen.
After confirming the voter's identity, the voter signs the ballot and places it in the ballot box.

Since 1988, ballot boxes have been made transparent, allowing voters and observers to verify that there are no extra ballots at the beginning of the voting and that no extra ballots are added, properly counted and authorized.
The candidates have the right to send representatives to monitor each stage of the process and, during the night, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision and in accordance with specific procedures.

Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya stated: "We have arrested five individuals who abused the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop computer."
Baba, Bhutha, Rampro, Gaza and Vishnu Kanjar are the accused.
According to Superintendent of Police Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the accused appeared before the court with their faces covered.
Despite three people being inside the house at the time of the impact of the car, none of them suffered injuries.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was closed temporarily while emergency services removed the driver of the Audi TT red from the vehicle.
Initially, it was moved to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been in the county court of Edinburgh, accused of the murder of her son.
While she is in custody awaiting trial, any eyewitness testimony may be questionable, as her image has been widely circulated.
It is a common practice in other parts of the United Kingdom, but as Scottish law works differently, the courts considered the publication of photographs as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee warned: "Journalists are walking on dangerous ground when they publish photos or other information about suspects."
The Crown Office, which is responsible for prosecutions, told journalists that it would not be making any further comment until the indictment was issued.
The leaked information will deal with the border conflict, which Palestine claims to resolve based on the existing boundaries prior to the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics that were reportedly discussed included the future status of Jerusalem, which both nations consider sacred, and the Jordan Valley problem.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after the agreement is signed, while PA accepts only five.
During the pest control trial, the shooters were closely monitored by the game wardens, as they were being monitored and evaluated for their effectiveness.
A partnership between NPWS and the NSW branch of the Australian Sporting Shooters Association recruited suitable volunteers for the Association's hunting program.
Mick O'Flynn, who is currently in charge of the interim Conservation and Heritage Office of NPWS, noted that comprehensive training and safety briefings were provided to the four shooters selected for the operation.
Yesterday, President Martelly swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP, for its English acronym) of nine members.
In four years, it is the fifth CEP of Martelly.
Last month, a presidential commission advised the previous CEP to resign, as part of a series of measures designed to lead the country towards new elections.
The commission was the way that Martelly responded to the widespread demonstrations that began in October against the regime.
The demonstrations, sometimes violent, were triggered by the fact that elections have not been held, in some cases since 2011.
Approximately 60 iPods have been reported to have problems with overheating and have caused six fires and minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) reported 27 accidents involving these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company classified as "not serious."
The ministry said it was "truly regrettable" that Apple had delayed its report.
Mariana was jolted by a 7.1 magnitude earthquake at 7:19 a.m. local time (21:19 GMT) on Friday.
The Northern Mariana Islands emergency management agency reported no damage on the Northern Mariana Islands.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also reported the absence of tsunami indicators.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former police officer of that country hijacked a bus and held tourists from Hong Kong hostage.
Rolando Mendoza opened fire with his M16 against foreign visitors.
Several hostages have been rescued and, to date, at least six have been confirmed dead.
Both the six hostages, including children and the Filipino photographers, were released early.
Later, photographers took the place of an elderly woman who needed to go to the bathroom. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began to study medicine.
She received training in obstetrics and worked at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland from 1959.
Liggins began his research on premature birth in his spare time while working at the hospital.
His study showed that fetal lung maturation could be accelerated by administering a hormone.
Xinhua reported that on Wednesday, investigators for the government recovered the flight-recording devices from the black box.
Luna's partner fighters also paid tribute.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first queen of the Extreme. She died on the night of the two moons, something unique, like her. A strong woman."
Dustin Runnels said: "Luna was as rare as I am; even more so. I love her and I miss her. I hope she is in a better place."
Since 2008, 8 per cent of those surveyed in advance of the 2010 federal election had indicated that they were opposed to Australia becoming a republic.
Julia Gillard, acting Prime Minister, stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic once the Queen II's term was completed.
34 per cent of those surveyed share this view and want Queen Isabel II to be the last Queen of Australia.
On one end of the survey, 29 per cent of people think Australia should become a republic as soon as possible; on the other, 31 per cent think it should never become a republic.
The gold medal winner in the 100-metre and 200-metre freestyle events at the Commonwealth Games had to swim three relays, but his physical condition has been called into question following his complaints.
He has not been able to take painkillers because they are banned at the Games.
On 25 January, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
Many people verified the discovery by using various hardware and software and it was announced on Tuesday.
Perhaps comets have served as a source of water for our planet, as well as organic material, which has the ability to form proteins and sustain life.
The scientists hope to understand how planets, including our own, were formed, as comets collided with Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office at the beginning of the year and the month before, signing a bill that allows same-sex couples to marry.
He dismissed the rumours as "political gossip and nonsense."
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system, according to the Federal Aviation Administration, that would reduce flight distances, saving millions of gallons of fuel per year, as well as carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology, in contrast to the old ground-based radar, to enable air traffic controllers to detect aircraft with greater precision and provide more accurate data to pilots.
No additional transport will be provided and trains will not stop at Wembley. Parking for cars and the deterrent will not be available.
Due to concern over possible lack of transportation, the possibility of playing the game closed to the public was considered.
On Thursday, Science magazine reported on a new species of bird that has appeared on the Galápagos Islands in Ecuador.
Experts at Princeton University, USA, and Uppsala University, Sweden, reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, much faster than previously estimated, due to the reproduction of a Darwin's Endemic, Geospiza fortis, with a cactus-migrating, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can take any shape and be made into tiny figures.
Not only can it be hammered and rolled into sheets, but it can also be stretched into a very fine wire that can be twisted and braided.
It can be very thin and adhere to another metal. It is so thin that it can be used to decorate hand-made illustrations in books called &quot; illuminated manuscripts &quot;.
This is called the pH of a chemical substance. You can make a pH indicator using red cabbage juice.
The colour of the cabbage juice will be altered depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical substance is.
The number of hydrogen ions (H in pH) present in the chemical sample determines its pH level.
Hydrogen atoms are formed by a proton and an electron. Thus, an ion of hydrogen is the result of removing a proton from an electron.
Mix both powders together and, after doing so, with clean and wet hands, form a ball.
A reaction will occur between the moisture on their hands and their outer layers, which will feel strange to the touch and form a kind of shell.
Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets with drainage in almost all houses, which connected to a sophisticated sewerage system.
In some homes in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece, traces of sewer systems were found.
Bathrooms were also found in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In the Roman civilization, public baths had toilets and some were shared by men and women.
When one communicates with someone who is thousands of miles away, one is using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back almost instantly.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space, because the atmosphere of Earth distorts part of the light and view we see.
A giant rocket is needed to carry a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in surprising ways. The most important thing it has done for us is to provide us with much simpler and faster transportation.
Thanks to it, we now have many means of transport, such as the railway or the car, among many others.
Below, there are smaller cats that feed on medium-sized prey, from rabbits to deer and elk.
Finally, there are many small wild cats (including domestic cats that are independent) that feed on species of small size that are much more numerous, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of niche: each cat has a particular function, which prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of the big cats and their lives are spent in large groups called prides.
A herd is formed by one to three adult males of the same family group, with up to 30 females and their offspring.
Female members of a species are usually closely related, making them a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave in much the same way as wolf packs or dogs, with surprising similarities (unlike other large cats) in their behaviour and lethality to their prey.
The tiger is a full-fledged athlete, able to climb (but not very well), swim, leap, and pull five times as hard as a strong person.
The tiger is of the same genus (Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These are the only four big cats capable of roaring.
The tiger's roar is not a full-throated roar like that of the lion, but rather a sentence of words spoken in growls and screams.
Ocelots enjoy eating small creatures, if possible, monkeys, rodents, squirrels and birds. Almost all their prey will be much smaller than themselves.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find prey (prey) by smell, smelling the ground where they have passed.
They have very good night vision and in dark places, and they move very quietly. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then pounce on them.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) moves away from the main population (for example, if they move to a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island), they will often find themselves in a different environment than they are used to.
The new environment has different resources and competitors, and therefore a new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor.
The original population has not changed, and they still need the same adaptations as in the past.
As the emerging population adapts to the new environment, it begins to resemble the other population less and less.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will be so different that they will no longer be classified as the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the development of new species, and is an ineluctable and fundamental part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that people breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that people exhale (which they exhale).
Plants generate food with solar energy, thanks to photosynthesis, and they also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants and also make clothes from them. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without them, animals would not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the alpha predator of its time, therefore, it feared nothing, except other members of its own species.
Its long jaws were studded with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, plus an additional group in the palate, which translates into anything that came its way had no escape.
We do not know for sure, but it could have been a viper. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs and even cannibalism.
It also attacked any creature that entered the water: even a T. rex as large as Tyrannosaurus rex was no match for it.
While most of the food we would recognize would have been familiar to Romans, they also ate some rather unusual items at banquets, such as wild boar, pheasants, snails and even a type of rodent, the dormouse.
Another difference was that the poor and women ate sitting down, while the wealthy enjoyed sharing banquets and lying down while eating.
It is not possible that the recipes of ancient Rome included foods that came to Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, chocolate, or any Roman ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a central temple for each of their gods, considered their home.
People brought sacrifices to the gods and priests sought to meet the needs of the people by performing rituals and festivals.
Temples have an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary that only priests could enter.
Sometimes, special towers with a pyramid shape were built to be part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for his deity.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was of little importance.
Jewish families spent most of their time outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were only showrooms; houses were built of stone.
There were no large forests in Canaan; therefore, wood was extremely expensive.
Few people lived in Greenland. According to Nordic sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, during a journey westward, discovered the island and named it.
However, the Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
While each country was &quot; Scandinavian &quot; in its own right, there were marked differences in terms of the people, monarchs, habits and history between Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you saw the movie National Treasure, you may believe that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, the reverse side of the document does contain writing, but it is not a map of a treasure.
The Declaration of Independence has the phrase "Original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776" written on the back, upside down.
Although the document was written by someone, it was known that it was hastily prepared, rolled up and stored.
It is therefore likely that the annotation was added only as a label.
While the D-Day landings and subsequent battles had succeeded in liberating northern France, the south remained to be won.
His government was under the control of the French "Vichy" group, which in 1940 had agreed to peace with the Germans and worked with the invaders rather than fighting against them.
On 15 August 1940, the "Operation Dragon" was launched, through which the Allies invaded southern France.
In just two weeks, American and French forces had liberated southern France and were on their way to Germany.
A civilization is a specific culture of a large group of people who live and work together; that is, a society.
The term civilization derives from the Latin word civis, which means citizen, and is related to civitas, which means city or city state, and which, in some way, determines the size of the society.
A state city is the precursor of a nation. A culture of civilization involves a long-term generational transmission of knowledge, a durable cultural legacy and a homogenous spread.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving any relevant historical traces, and are not recognized as civilizations in their own right.
During the American Revolution, the thirteen states formed, initially, a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation, in which the Congress was the only component.
The Congress did not have the power to levy taxes and, since it lacked a national executive or judicial power, the function fell to the state authorities, who often did not cooperate in enforcing all its laws.
He was not empowered to annul tax or customs laws between states.
The articles called for unanimous approval by all states to amend the Constitution and the states gave so little importance to the central government that their representatives often did not show up.
The Italian national football team, together with the German national team, is the second team with the most victories in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among the sports most popular are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, figure skating and Formula 1.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern regions, with athletes competing in international tournaments and Olympic events.
Japan has about 7000 islands (Honshu is the largest), making it the seventh largest archipelago in the world.
Due to the conglomerate/group of islands that it contains, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago," from a geographical point of view.
The history of Taiwan goes back to the 15th century, when European sailors who sailed through the area registered the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, meaning Beautiful Island.
The establishment, in 1624, by the Dutch East India Company of a base in southwestern Taiwan, marked the beginning of a transformation in the indigenous method of grain production, with the employment of Chinese labour to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
The Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the coastal and western region of Taiwan in 1683 and declared it a dependent province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded Taiwan to Japan, which retained control over the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three major buildings: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings at the complex have been reconstructed at the ends to allow tourists to see how they originally looked.
By 1976, 30 per cent of Machu Picchu had been restored and work continues today.
For example, the most common format for still photography worldwide is 35 mm, which was the most widely used film size towards the end of the film era.
Today, it is still produced, but the most important thing is that its dimensional relationship has been transferred to the formats of digital camera sensors.
In fact, the 35 mm format is somewhat confusing, as its measurements are 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
Thus, the dimensional ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to calculate the simplest common divisor) is 3:2.
Many typical formats (e.g., APS) are similar or very similar to this appearance.
The rule of thirds, which has been the subject of constant ridicule and often scorned, is a simple pattern that generates dynamism while allowing for some order to be imposed on the images.
The most effective position for the central object is the intersection formed by the horizontal and vertical lines that divide the image into thirds (see example).
During this phase of European history, the Catholic Church, which had accumulated wealth and power, was questioned.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity had succeeded in uniting European states, despite their different languages and customs.
Its power was everywhere, from the monarch to the commoner.
One of the most important principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that church funds should be reserved for that specific purpose.
The central dome of the church had remained in Rome for over a thousand years and this concentration of power and money made many wonder whether this principle was being respected.
Soon after hostilities began, the British began a naval blockade of Germany.
While the strategy, which involved the interruption of vital military and civilian supplies, was successful, it violated generally recognized and widely accepted international law and was contained in several international agreements of the last two centuries.
Britain extracted international waters in whole sectors of the ocean to block the entry of ships, even risking the safety of neutral vessels.
With a reduced response to this tactic, Germany believed it would face a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the attitude adopted by most citizens and nations was one of pacifism and isolation.
After the horrors and atrocities of World War I, the countries wanted to avoid a repeat of such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job at Edison in New York.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents, a book of poems and a recommendation letter from Charles Batchelor (his last manager) addressed to Thomas Edison.
The ancient China had a unique way of delimiting different time periods. Each dynasty or each ruling family was a separate dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there was also a period of instability, with provinces divided. The most well-known was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years, during the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, a bloody war broke out among many nobles who were vying for the throne.
One of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China was the Three Kingdoms, where thousands of people died in a struggle for the throne of the great palace in Xi'an.
The political and social consequences are many, including the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the conviction that the country belongs to the people, not to a single sovereign.
Likewise, after the Revolution, the posts were open to all male candidates, which allowed the most ambitious and prestigious to succeed.
The same is true of the military, where charges are now based on the caliber of the weapon.
The French Revolution was also an inspiration for many other oppressed people in other countries to launch their own revolutions.
Mahoma was deeply interested in matters beyond this worldly life. He often visited a cave known as "Hira" in the mountain of "Noor" (light) to reflect.
The cave itself, which had endured the test of time, realistically illustrated the spiritual inclinations of Mohammed.
At the peak of one of the mountains north of Mecca, a cave is totally cut off from the rest of the planet.
It is indeed very difficult to find, even if one is sure of its existence. Inside the cave, isolation is total.
Nothing can be seen but the wonderful clear sky and the many mountains around it. From inside this cave, one can see or hear very little of this world.
Of the seven wonders, the only one still standing is the Great Pyramid of Giza.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptian people in the third century BC, is one of many pyramids of similar size and shape built to honour the deceased pharaoh.
The Guiza Necropolis, or "Valley of the Kings" in the Valley of the Kings, Egypt, contains numerous pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honour of Pharaoh Khufu, and many other pyramids and smaller tombs and temples were built in honour of his wives and relatives.
The "upward arrow" mark is similar to a V and the "downward arrow" mark is similar to a nail or square without its bottom edge.
Up means to start at the tip and push the bow, and down means to start at the frog, where the hand holds the bow, and pull it.
The ascending arc produces a softer sound, while a descending arc is more forceful and abrupt.
Feel free to make your own marks with pencil, but remember that marks on stringed instruments have been made in that place for musical purposes and should be respected.
On 6 October 1789, a mob of women from the market forced the terrified King Louis XVI, his wife Marie Antoinette, their two small children (Marie Teresa, 11, and Louis Charles, 4) and his sister, Madame Elizabeth, to return to Paris from Versailles.
They returned to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a mob that shouted and threatened the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriage fully.
At one point, a participant in the uprising shook the head of a executed royal guard in front of the Queen, who was in panic.
The Filipino people paid the costs of the imperialism of the United States in the conquest of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to cover most of the interest and principal on the Philippine bonds held in Wall Street banks.
Already, the superprofits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would be the main source of American imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, one must understand the context that gave rise to the establishment of the order.
The European period in which these events took place is usually known as the Middle Ages, between the eleventh, twelfth and thirteenth centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The Middle Ages followed the Early Middle Ages and was followed by the Late Middle Ages, which, by convention, ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a concept that encompasses, pragmatically, a broad range of ideas, from the technological imperative to a strict sense that there is a logic underlying the destiny of humanity and that is related to the laws of science and how they are reflected in technology.
Almost all interpretations of technological determinism have in common two general ideas: that technological development proceeds along an independent path from any cultural or political influence, and that technology has &quot; effects &quot; on societies that are inherent and not socially conditioned.
One could argue that the existence of automobiles necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a national network of roads is not economically viable for a small number of cars, and new techniques of manufacture are being developed to reduce the cost of ownership of a car.
The widespread use of automobiles also leads to a higher incidence of traffic accidents, which leads to the development of new techniques in the field of health care to repair damaged bodies.
The cultural determinism element was very present in romanticism, as studied by Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped people and, over time, developed customs and cultures related to that geography that, being in harmony with the location of that society, were preferable to laws imposed arbitrarily.
As Paris is now known as the fashion capital of the world, so was Constantinople considered to be in feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a centre of luxury began approximately 400 BC and extended to approximately 1100 BC.
During the twelfth century, its status declined, especially because the Crusaders brought back gifts, such as silks and spices, which were valued more highly than the goods offered in the Byzantine markets.
The title of &quot; fashion capital &quot; was then transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The apex of Gothic style occurred in the period between the Xth and XIVth centuries.
At first, the way people dressed was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to the slow communication channels, Western styles could be 25 to 30 years behind.
In the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most significant developments of this period was the introduction of buttons as a fastening device.
Subsistence agriculture is understood as that which is intended to produce sufficient food to meet the needs of the farmer and his or her family alone.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic practice that combines the use of seeds from the region's original ecological area with crop rotation or other comparatively simple methods to maximize production.
Historically, most farmers in developing countries were subsistence farmers, and this remains the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together individuals with similar ideas and feelings of alienation from social norms and provide a sense of identity.
Many factors can distinguish subcultures: age, ethnicity, class, location or gender of their members.
The distinguishing features of a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, sexual, geographical or related to religion or politics, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often exhibit distinctive and symbolic style, such as fashions, gestures and slang, to identify themselves as belonging to that subculture.
One of the most common ways to graphically illustrate the importance of socializing is to analyze the few and lamentable cases of children who, through neglect, misfortune or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults during their growth.
These children are called "wild." Some wild children are confined by their parents, usually their parents.
Wild children may have suffered traumatic or severe abuse before being abandoned or running away.
It is said that others were raised by animals and that some have lived in the wild.
When a child is raised exclusively by animals other than humans, he or she exhibits behaviour (within his or her physical capabilities) almost identical to that of the specific animal that cared for him or her, as well as fear or indifference towards people.
Although project-based learning should make this process easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a bit further.
The scaffolding is not a learning technique; it is rather a support that provides assistance to those who are experiencing a new experience, such as the use of a new computer program or the beginning of a new project.
The scaffolding can be either real or virtual; to put it another way, a teacher is a type of scaffolding, but also a PowerPoint animation.
Virtual scaffolding is built into software and its function is to question, stimulate or explain procedures that may have been complex for the student to grasp on his or her own.
Children are placed in foster homes for a wide variety of reasons, from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment without love, care and education, but it happens.
We can see that the family care system provides a safe environment for these children.
The goal of our foster care system is to provide safe, loving homes, consistent education and reliable medical care.
The purpose of family care is to cover all needs that were not met in the home of origin.
The Internet unites and mixes components of mass communication and between people.
The different features of the Internet open up new dimensions from the perspective of the concept of uses and rewards.
For example, &quot; learning &quot; and &quot; socialization &quot; are cited as significant incentives for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
During a study of user reactions to web sites conducted by Eighmey and McCord (1998), "personal involvement" and "lasting relationships" were also identified as new motivational factors.
Through video recording, significant findings have been made in the interpretation of microexpressions, which are facial movements lasting only a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is claimed that by reading a person's microexpressions, it is possible to detect whether a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, explained how those who cannot understand speech because of brain damage can, nevertheless, judge the sincerity of a speaker.
It even suggests that the skills for interpreting human behaviour can be shared with animals, such as domestic dogs.
Through the research of the 20th century, two types of genetic variation have been identified: the hidden and the manifest.
Mutation involves the introduction of a new genetic variation; selection removes that variation from the set.
Segregation and recombination shuffle the variation between one generation and the next.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate, whose digestive system is similar to that of humans, to satisfy its amino acid needs with the plant resources available to it.
Failure to do so carries serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition and, ultimately, death.
The proteins in leaves and legumes would have been a more easily accessible source of vegetable resources, but they are not easily digestible for primates such as ourselves, except when cooked.
Animal-derived foods (ants, termites, eggs) are easy to digest and provide a large number of proteins containing all the essential amino acids.
In short, it should not surprise us if our own ancestors solved their "protein problems" in the same way that chimpanzees in the Sahel do today.
Waking up on purpose during the normal sleep period and then going back to sleep (10 to 60 minutes).
This can be easily achieved with a soft alarm clock that will bring the sleeper back to a conscious state, but not fully awaken him or her.
The registration is an additional requirement for the visa process. In some countries, the applicant must register his or her presence and address with local authorities.
Other options that are based on the biological rhythm include drinking a lot of liquid (especially water or tea, a diuretic) before going to bed, which will make him or her get up to urinate.
The level of inner peace a person enjoys is inversely related to the amount of tension in his or her body and mind.
The lower the tension, the greater the force of life with which we are endowed. Each of us has the potential for absolute peace and happiness.
We can all achieve enlightenment. The only thing that stands in our way is our own tension and negativity.
While the basis of Tibetan Buddhism is the teachings of Buddha, it has been extended through the path of Mahayana love and many techniques of Indian yoga.
In general, laísmo is very simple. It is based on kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of love that encompasses everything.
In Kundalini Yoga, the energy Kundalini (illumination) is activated through yoga postures, breathing practices, mantras or visualization.
Tibetan meditation focuses on the Devata Yoga, through visualization of deities, the energy channels can be cleared, the chakras activated and the consciousness of enlightenment developed.
The cooperation between the USSR and the USA was the result of facing a common enemy, Germany, during World War II. After the war, the clash of systems, processes and cultures led to the two countries drifting apart.
Two years after the end of the war, those who were allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and be fought in real terms, through proxy militias, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, among many other places.
Because the Polish defence was already broken by 17 September 1939, its only hope was to withdraw and reorganize in the area of the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans fell into disuse almost overnight, when more than 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers entered and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international, bilateral and multilateral agreements.
Using ships to transport goods is a much more efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across the oceans.
The function of the navy has always been to ensure that its country retains the ability to transport its people and goods, while at the same time interfering with the enemy's ability to do the same.
The North Atlantic campaign during World War II offers one of the clearest and most recent examples of this.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly submarines, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had not succeeded, Germany might have taken power in Britain, as it did in the other European countries.
Goats were domesticated for the first time, about 10 000 years ago, in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
With the aim of easily obtaining their milk, hair, meat and hides, ancient peoples and tribes began to hunt them.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills or other areas of grazing, tended by goat herders who were often children or adolescents, similar to the most popular shepherd.
In England, railways had been installed by the 16th century.
Although the rails of the carriages were made of simple wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling them to achieve greater speed and pull heavier loads than on the somewhat rougher roads of the day.
The use of sleepers to keep rails in place was quite early, but gradually it was realized that rails would be more efficient if they were covered with iron on the upper part.
This became a common practice, although iron wheels on the wagons caused greater wear on the wooden wheels.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels, and in 1767, iron rails were used.
The first form of transport known was walking. Humans began to do so upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (which means upright man).
Australopithecus did not walk erect.
While bipedal traces have been found in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, it is possible that Sahelanthropus walked on two legs 7 million years ago.
We can begin to live more friendly with the planet, join environmental movements or even become activists and fight to lessen, in some way, future suffering.
In many cases, it is like the treatment of an asymptomatic condition. But if we are not just looking for a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problem and try to eliminate it.
The world has undergone great changes, owing to technological and scientific advances by humankind, and problems have intensified owing to overpopulation and extravagant lifestyles.
After being approved by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft was sent to the printer, John Dunlap, a few blocks away, for printing.
Approximately 150 to 200 copies were made during the night, which are now known as the "Dunlap copies."
It was John Nixon who read the document for the first time in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
A copy was sent to George Washington, who ordered it read to his army in New York on 9 July. Another copy was sent to London on 10 August.
The 25 Dunlap photographs, which are known to still exist, are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original is lost.
A large number of paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive today. They are birds.
Many people do not see them as dinosaurs, as they have feathers and can fly.
However, there are many features in birds that still make them look like dinosaurs.
They have clawed limbs and lay eggs, and move on their hind legs in a manner similar to the Tyrannosaurus Rex.
Currently, most computers operate on the basis of the manipulation of data coded in the binary system.
A binary number can only have one of two values, they are 0 and 1, and, according to computer jargon, these numbers are known as binary digits, or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately evident. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are too common to allow for immediate diagnosis.
The clearest indicator of internal poisoning may be finding an opened bottle of medicine or toxic cleaning products.
Read the label for specific information on the first aid for that specific poison.
Entomologists use the term parasite insect in a formal sense to refer to this group of arthropods.
The word comes from its former relationship with fleas, a very developed species for parasitizing humans.
Bedbugs and chiggers are nymphs; they are adapted to inhabit the nest or home of their host.
The number of cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the United States is estimated at about 400 000, making it the most common neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
The central nervous system, consisting of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve, is the target of multiple sclerosis.
The studies showed that women have twice the odds of men of developing EM.
A couple might conclude that having a baby would not be the most convenient thing for them or for the child.
These couples could choose to plan for the adoption of a child.
In an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that a different couple can care for the child.
The aim of science is to decipher the way the world works through the scientific method, and this method is the guide for most scientific research.
It is not an experiment, but a test used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, guiding scientific research.
The focus of both naturalists and philosophers was on the classical works, especially the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle's thoughts, especially those on science, even psychology, were accepted.
As the Greek language waned, Western civilization distanced itself from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms present in physiological processes and in behaviour are decisively dependent on internal cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not only responses to regular external stimuli, have been recorded in almost all living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks oscillate autonomously and have a free-running period, even in the absence of external stimuli.
One of the key indicators that DNA was a genetic material was the experiment conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase inserted their own DNA into a bacteria using fagos, or viruses.
They conducted two experiments in which they marked the DNA of the frog with radioactive phosphorus or the DNA of the frog with radioactive sulfur.
Depending on the type of mutation, the size of the affected piece of genetic material and whether it involves germ cells, the mutation may have various effects.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cellular death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism usually attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, which includes wild animal and plant life.
Some possible activities at the site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visiting parks, and studying information on the ecosystem.
One example is visiting, taking photographs and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in their cars to go to work, and they often encounter others whose jobs are in the place they just left.
In this dynamic transfer system, everyone is somehow connected to a system of transport based on the use of private cars, and supports it.
Today, scientists maintain that this massive carbon economy has deprived the biosphere of one of its stable states, which has contributed to human evolution over the past two million years.
All are part of society and use the transportation systems; and almost all complain about them.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear complaints about water quality or bridge collapses.
What is the reason for the complaints of such magnitude and why do they occur daily? Are the transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is there something more substantial going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the individual movement of drivers and vehicles between two points and of their interactions.
Unfortunately, it is not an easy task to study the flow of traffic, as it is not possible to make accurate predictions about the behaviour of drivers.
Fortunately, there is a tendency for drivers to maintain relatively consistent behaviour, which allows traffic flows to be reasonably consistent and amenable to approximate mathematical representation.
In order to graphically illustrate the flow of circulation, the three most important elements (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed) were related.
Such relationships facilitate both the planning and design of roadways and the operations of roadways.
The first to fly were insects. This helped them evade enemies more easily and find food and mates more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings backwards, attaching them to the sides of their bodies.
This provides them with a larger pool of small places to hide from predators.
Currently, only the anisoptera and the ephemeroptera are unable to fold their wings.
Aristarchus, a Greek astronomer, commented that the Sun was at the centre of the Solar System.
There were those who shared his theory, but many others believed the opposite: that the solar system orbited the Earth, even the Sun and other stars.
This seems to make sense, since the Earth does not perceive its movement, does it?
The Amazon is the largest river in the world and the second largest river in the world in terms of volume of water.
The Amazon is the widest river on Earth, in some places up to six miles wide.
Of the total water from rivers in the world that flows into the oceans, 20 per cent comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River is 6387 km (3980 miles) long and receives water from thousands of smaller rivers.
While stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Ancient Kingdom, they never surpassed the size or the sublime technique of the building of the pyramids of Guiza.
The ancient Egyptian town of New Kingdom was amazed by the monuments of its ancestors, which at that time were more than a thousand years old.
With approximately 800 inhabitants, the Vatican City is the world &apos; s smallest independent country and the least populous.
Italian is used in the Vatican for drafting its legislation and for issuing its official communiqués.
The language that most people working in the state use on a daily basis is also Italian, and the use of Latin is usually reserved for religious ceremonies.
The total number of citizens living in the Vatican City State who are Roman Catholic.
The basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper are known since antiquity, since all of them can be found in nature in their original form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
Aristotle developed the theory that everything is made up of a combination of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air and fire.
It was more similar to the states of matter (with the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, but it also had the theory that they transform into new substances that make up the things we see.
Alloys are, basically, a combination of two or more metals. Remember that the periodic table has many elements.
Metals are considered to be elements such as calcium and potassium. There are also metals such as gold and silver.
Alloys may also contain small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter, composed of tiny particles called atoms.
The size of atoms is so impressively small that the period at the end of this sentence could contain billions of them.
For this reason, when the pencil was invented, it made many friends.
Unfortunately, the use of the pencil has declined since the introduction of new writing methods, and it has lost its status.
People today write messages on their computer screens. They do not even need to get near a pencil.
Only time will tell what will become of the keyboard when something newer comes along.
The atomic bomb operates on the principle that energy is required to form a nucleus with a large number of protons and neutrons.
It is similar to what happens when a heavy car rolls up a hill, splitting the nucleus once again, releasing some of that energy.
Some atoms are unstable, meaning that they tend to break apart with the minimum or almost no push.
The surface of the moon is composed of rocks and dust and its outer shell is called the crust.
The crust has a thickness of about 70 km on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under the lunar maria and thicker under the highlands.
It is possible that there are more lakes on the side closer to the surface due to the thinner crust, which facilitated the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on what attracts or pleases people.
These theories hold that people have certain needs or desires that have been internalized as they have grown older.
These theories examine what makes people want the things they do and what factors in their environment make them do or not do certain things.
Two well-known theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
There are two types of behaviour that managers exhibit when they begin to lead their former colleagues. On one end of the spectrum is the attempt to continue to be "one of the boys" (or girls).
These managers have difficulty making decisions that are unpopular with employees, imposing discipline, conducting performance evaluations, assigning responsibilities and demanding accountability from staff.
On the other end of the spectrum, it mutates into an individual who believes that everything that has been done in the past must be changed and done in his or her own way.
In the end, the ultimate success or failure of the team is the leader.
This behaviour often leads to the leaders of the team being distanced from the other members of the team.
The same standards of excellence that apply to conventional equipment apply to virtual, although there are small differences.
Virtual team members often serve as a point of contact for their physical team.
They usually enjoy greater autonomy than members of a traditional group, as their teams can meet at different times, for example, times that might not be understood by local management.
The existence of an "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique element of virtual teams.
The "invisible team" is the group in charge of managing and each member reports to. It sets the standards for each member.
What motivation could an organization have for submitting to the process of establishing an organization for learning?</p>

When all available resources are used appropriately in an organization's operational departments, space is created for creativity and ingenuity.
As a result, the process of an organization working together to overcome a location challenge to a new innovative process to meet customer needs.
To be innovative, leadership must first create an innovation culture, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuous approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide factual evidence for a theoretical approach to cognitive research. They therefore reduce the field of research and make it more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behaviour contributes to the research of scientists.
For many years, it has been known that various types of brain injury, trauma, lesions and tumors affect behaviour and cause changes in mental functioning.
Thanks to the advent of new technologies, we now have the ability to see and investigate structures and processes in the brain that have never been seen before.
This provides us with abundant information and material for developing simulation models, which help us to understand mental processes.
While artificial intelligence is often associated with science fiction, it is a major branch of computer science that deals with intelligent behaviour, learning and adaptation in a machine.
AI research involves the development of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behaviour.
Examples include monitoring, planning and programming, the ability to respond to diagnostic queries and consults from clients, as well as facial, signature and voice recognition.
These issues have become separate disciplines, focused on providing solutions to real-world problems.
Artificial Intelligence is now often used in the economy, medicine, engineering and military, as it was incorporated into various applications of video games and personal computers.
Field trips are an important part of any classroom. It is very common for a teacher to want to take her students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
The solution comes from technology, through virtual field trips. Students can view exhibits at a museum, visit an aquarium or view beautiful works of art sitting in their classroom.
Sharing a virtual excursion is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, the students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a web page about their trip to the state capital and every year the page is updated, but the previous versions are kept online as a memory album.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing skills. Although students often begin their blogging experience with a careless grammar and spelling, this usually changes when they have an audience.
Because students are often the most critical readers, the blogger is trying to improve his writing, in order to avoid criticism.
Blogging also requires students to be more aware of the world around them. The need to engage the audience inspires them to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a resource that inspire collaboration and encourage students to go beyond the typical school day.
The appropriate use of blogs &quot; can empower students to be more analytical and critical, through active response to internet content, can define their positions in the context of other people's writings, and establish their perspectives on specific topics &quot; (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the bilingual capital of Canada and is home to a variety of museums and art galleries that showcase the history and the present of the country.
The Niagara Falls are south and the north hosts the natural beauty of Muskoka and the extension that follows.
All these aspects, and others, make Ontario intrinsically Canadian in the eyes of foreigners.
The large areas further north are sparsely populated and some are wild lands, almost uninhabited.
For a population comparison that is a surprise to many, more African Americans live in the United States than in Canada.
The location of the East African islands is on the eastern coast of that continent, in the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar is, by far, the largest and most self-contained continent in terms of wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent or associated with France and are popular for their beaches and luxury tourist complexes.
Islam was also brought to the Comoros and Mayotte by Arabs and largely imposed.
The initial European and colonial influence took place in the 15th century, following the discovery by the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama of the route that links Europe with India.
The region borders the Sahel to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: All female visitors are advised to say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
A ring (just make sure it doesn &apos; t look too expensive).
Women need to be aware that cultural differences can lead to what they consider harassment, and that it is not uncommon for them to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be round and don't be afraid to defend your position (cultural differences or not, that is not correct!).
The founders of modern Casablanca were the Berbers in the 10th century BC and the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids, who used it as a strategic port, called Anfa.
It was destroyed and rebuilt by the Portuguese as the White House, but abandoned in 1755 after an earthquake.
The city was rebuilt by the Moroccan sultan under the name Daru l-Badya and the Spanish traders who set up their businesses there called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the most boring places in Morocco for shopping.
In the vicinity of the old Medina, there are many places where traditional Moroccan items are sold, such as earthenware, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes and a whole range of trinkets, but everything is geared to tourists.
Goma is a tourist destination in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, on the eastern border with Rwanda.
In 2002, lava from the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma and left much of its streets submerged, especially in the city centre.
While Goma is fairly safe, any visit outside should be considered to take stock of the situation in the North Kivu province, where fighting continues.
The city is the base for climbing the volcano Nyiragongo and its gorilla trekking excursions are the most economical in Africa.
To travel within Goma, one can take a boda-boda (mototaxi). The regular fare (local) is CDF500 (Congolese francs) for a short trip.
This, coupled with its relative inaccessibility, has given "Tombuctú" an exotic and faraway image.
Although today Tombuctú is a poor city, it still has an airport and its reputation makes it a tourist attraction.
In 1990, it was inscribed on the World Heritage List, as a result of the threat of the encroaching sands.
It was one of the most important stops on the PBS special Maravillas del mundo africano, hosted by Henry Louis Gates.
The city contrasts sharply with the rest of the country, as it has a more Arab style than African.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and extends along the eastern border with Mozambique, north to Zimbabwe and south to the Crocodile River.
The park has an area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which has a different wild life.
This is one of the most important attractions in South Africa and is recognized as the main icon of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in all South African nature reserves, there are daily fees for conservation and access to the park.
A Wild Card can also be purchased to allow entry to all South African National Parks or to selected parks in the country.
The territory of Hong Kong takes its name from the island of Hong Kong, which is the destination of most tourists who consider it the main attraction.
The skyline of Hong Kong has been compared to a bar chart showing the presence of Victoria Harbour waters.
The best views of Hong Kong are to be had by leaving the island and heading to Kowloon Bay, which is located on the other side.
The reclaimed land in the north of Hong Kong is where the city's urban development is most densely concentrated.
This is the site that the British conquerors adopted as their own. It is a good place to start if you want to see evidence of the colonial past of this region.
The Sundarbans are the world &apos; s largest mangrove forest, extending 80 km (50 miles) from the coast of Bangladesh and India.
UNESCO has declared the Sundarbans a World Heritage site. The forest within Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
Despite this, the forests are not just mangroves, but also contain some of the last remaining trees from the once-imposing jungles that once covered the flat Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2 and is home to about one third of its total area.
The Sundarbans has been a temple of wild life since 1966 and is estimated to have 400 Royal Bengal tigers and 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses leave the station between districts (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, but most, especially those travelling east to Jakar (also called Bumthang) leave between 6:30 and 7:30 a.m.
Because buses between districts are often crowded, it is recommended to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Almost all districts have the Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and durable.
Sharing a taxi ride is a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places such as Paro (150 ngultrums) and Punakha (200 ngultrums).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cantilever structure that spans the river, connecting Oiapoque, Brazil, and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 m, with a length of 378 m and two lanes of 3.5 m width.
Under the bridge there is a 15-metre-wide gap, although the bridge was completed in August 2011, it was not opened for traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational by September 2017, which is when it is expected that Brazilian customs controls will be completed.
The area that is now eastern Paraguay was inhabited by the Guarani, the largest indigenous group in that region, who lived as nomadic hunters, in addition to practicing subsistence agriculture.
The region also hosted other indigenous groups, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who hunted, gathered and fished for subsistence.
Paraguay, formerly known as "The Great Province of India," was born in the 16th century as a result of the encounter between the Spanish conquerors and the native indigenous peoples.
The Spanish began the stage of colonization, which lasted for three centuries.
Since the establishment of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has been able to retain much of its aboriginal identity and culture.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The most important tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
Other tournaments and matches are held at other times of the year.
Information on the Argentine Polo Association tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches can be obtained at the site.
The Falkland Islands pound (FKP), the official currency of the Falkland Islands, is fixed at par with the British pound (GBP).
There is only one bank on the islands. It is located in front of the FIC West store in Stanley.
Sterling is accepted at any location within the islands. In Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also accepted.
There is a chance that credit cards will not be accepted on the outer islands, but cash, British or American dollars may be used.
It is virtually impossible to change money from the Falkland Islands outside the archipelago, so do so before leaving.
Because of its southerly location, Montevideo is in summer when the northern hemisphere is in winter and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the tropics, with frequent summer temperatures of +30°C.
Winter can be deceptive: while it is very rare for temperatures to fall below the point of freezing, wind and humidity interact to make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no "rainy" or "dry" stations; the amount of rain is almost the same throughout the year.
While many animals in the park are accustomed to seeing people, wild life remains wild, and should not be fed or interfered with.
According to the authorities of the parks, bears and wolves should be at least 100 yards/metres away, and other wild animals at least 25 yards/metres away.
Despite their gentle appearance, bison, bighorn sheep, elk, moose and most large animals can be aggressive.
Dozens of visitors are injured every year by not maintaining a safe distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous; therefore, respect their space.
Also, remember that bears and other wild animals are attracted to smells, so keep your food and cooking smells to a minimum and keep your camp clean.
The capital of Samoa, Apia, is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of about 40,000.
Apia is the capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, the port was the scene of a disastrous naval battle when seven German, American and English ships refused to leave the port.
They sank all the ships, except one British cruiser. Two hundred Americans and Germans died.
During the Mau movement for independence, a peaceful meeting in the city ended with the assassination of the head of state Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches in Auckland, due to the fact that it has two ports. The most well-known are in three areas.
In the North Harbour district of the Pacific Ocean, the North Shore beaches stretch from Long Bay, north, to Devonport, south.
Most beaches are sandy with safe swimming areas and most have pohutukawa trees providing shade.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive, the extravagant suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, in the central Auckland region, are all part of the Waitemata Harbour.
These are family beaches, sometimes very crowded, with numerous and varied shops available, and also safe for swimming.
Number One is the most popular local beer, which is not complex, but rather refreshing and pleasant.
While there is a wide variety of French wines, those from New Zealand and Australia may be considered better for transport.
The local tap water is perfectly safe for drinking, but if he is concerned, he will find bottled water easily.
The Australians consider the notion of "flat white" to be foreign. A small black coffee is called an espresso, cappuccino is served with cream (rather than foam) and tea is not served with milk.
Hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but delicious.
Numerous trips to the reef are made throughout the year and, there, wounds from any of these causes are rare.
However, heed the advice of the authorities, respect all signs and pay particular attention to security alerts.
Jellyfish are found near beaches and estuaries of rivers from October to April, north of 1770.
Tigers do exist, but almost never attack people. Most of them fear and would swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles are not found in the ocean, but in the estuaries of rivers north of Rockhampton.
The advance booking of accommodation gives the traveller the peace of mind that he or she will have a place to sleep when he or she arrives at his or her destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, but through them it is also possible to book other types of accommodation, such as camping areas.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transfers from and to the airport, and even combined flight and accommodation packages.
They may also hold the reservation in case the traveller needs time to think about the offer, or to obtain other documents for his or her destination (such as a visa).
However, any modification or request must be made through the travel agent first, and not directly to the hotel.
At many festivals, most attendees camp at the event site and most spectators consider camping to be a crucial part of the experience.
If you want to get close to the action, you should arrive early to stake out a place near the musical events.
Please be aware that while the musical performances may have ended, other areas of the festival may continue into the early hours of the morning.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you are crossing the Baltic Sea in winter, check where the cabin is located, as crossing the ice causes a lot of noise for those most affected.
During the cruises to St. Petersburg, passengers also have time to visit the city. Visa requirements are waived for those who disembark (see terms).
Casinos normally make great efforts to maximize the time and money spent by their customers. There are usually no windows or clocks and exits can be difficult to find.
They often offer special food, drink and entertainment to keep guests in good spirits and within the facility.
Some establishments serve free alcoholic drinks. While intoxication affects judgment, a good player knows the importance of staying sober.
Anyone planning to drive in high latitudes or mountain passes should be prepared for the possibility of snow, ice or low temperatures.
On icy or snow-covered roads, there is little friction, so it is not possible to drive as one would on bare asphalt.
During snowstorms, a large amount of snow can fall, leaving it trapped in a very short time.
Visibility can also be reduced by snow or ice on the car windows.
On the other hand, in many countries, ice and snow are normal and traffic flows almost without interruption throughout the year.
Safaris are likely to be the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the most memorable part of many visitors' trips.
The term safari refers to the popular land-based travel to see the surprising wildlife of Africa, particularly in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often approach vehicles and standard equipment will provide good visibility.
Lions, leopards and jaguars can be shy, so you will have a better chance of seeing them using binoculars.
The walking safari, also known as "bush walk," "safari on foot," or "hike," is a walking expedition, either for a few hours or for several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021. A number of events will be held at other locations in Japan.
Host of the 1964 Olympic Games, Tokyo is the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games.
If you reserved your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement, you may face complications.
There are different types of travel cancellation insurance, but since late March, coverage for most of these coronavirus-based travel insurance policies has ended in July 2020, which is when the Olympics are scheduled to take place.
Most of the tickets to the events are expected to cost between JPY 2,500 and JPY 130,000, and common passes are expected to cost JPY 7,000.
Ironing wet clothes can help them dry. Many hotels provide an iron and ironing board for guests, even if they are not in the room.
If a hair dryer is not available, a hair straightener can be used.
Do not let the fabric get too hot, as it may shrink or burn.
Various methods of purifying water exist, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some places, boiling water for a minute is enough, in others, several more are needed.
Not all filters are equally effective, and if this is a concern, bottled water with a seal from a certified company should be considered.
Plagues of animals that are not known in the regions from which they come may be encountered by travellers.
Pests are capable of destroying food, causing irritation or, in more serious cases, triggering allergic reactions, spreading poison or transmitting infections.
Infectious diseases, alone, or dangerous animals, which can injure or kill individuals through the use of their force, are not usually included in the category of plagues.
The duty-free purchase of goods offers an opportunity to acquire, in certain places, goods free of customs duties and consumption taxes.
Taxpayers who travel to countries with high tax rates can, sometimes, save a significant amount of money, particularly on items such as spirits and tobacco.
The Buffalo-Pittsburgh Turnpike segment between Point Marion and Fairmont is the most challenging stretch of road and often traverses remote and lonely terrain.
If you do not normally drive on rural roads, be alert: there are many steep hills, narrow lanes and tight curves.
The posted speed limits are notoriously lower than those on the preceding and following segments, usually 35 to 40 mph (56 to 64 km/h), and strict enforcement is even more important than on any other segment.
However, curiously, the signal from cell phones is much better here than in many other sections of the road, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastry is of good quality and, in Bavaria, the cakes are quite tasty and varied, similar to those made in Austria, its southern neighbour.
Fruitcakes are common, with apples baked inside all year and cherries and plums appearing in the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. In general, popular cakes make a good combination with a strong cup of coffee.
If you fancy a small but tasty pastry, try the Berliner, also known as a Pfannkuchen or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a recipe of herbs and spices and served with meat or vegetables.
We can find &quot;dry &quot; and &quot; wet &quot; curry, depending on the amount of liquid.
In the villages of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curry. In southern India and other coastal areas of South Asia, coconut milk is more common.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a generic term encompassing a wide variety of regional cuisines that are spread throughout the country.
However, the term is often used without any other qualifier, referring to the original cuisine of the central and eastern regions of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, now available throughout the archipelago, offers a variety of dishes seasoned with simple spices, with the predilection of Javanese people for peanuts, chillies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and aromatic spices.
The stirrups are the supports for the rider's feet that hang on both sides of the saddle.
While providing greater stability for the rider, they can present safety problems as the rider's feet may become entangled in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse, but his foot is caught in the stirrup, he may be dragged if the animal bolts. To reduce the risk, a series of safety harnesses are available.
First, most riders use riding boots with a toe cap and a narrow, smooth sole.
In addition, English saddles have safety bars that allow the saddle to be detached from the tree if a rider who is thrown off pulls back.
The Cochamó Valley is the most popular climbing destination in Chile and is known as the South American Yosemite, with a variety of extensive walls and granite cliffs.
