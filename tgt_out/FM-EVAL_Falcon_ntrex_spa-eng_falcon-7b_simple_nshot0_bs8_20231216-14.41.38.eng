To the Members of the Welsh Assembly (AM, for its English acronym) we are concerned about “appearing muppets”
Some Members of the Assembly are confused by the suggestion that the title of the Assembly should be changed to Members of the Parliament for Wales (MPW, for its acronym in English).
This confusion arises from the plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the Assembly from all spectrums of the political spectrum are concerned that this could be ridiculed.
A member of the Labour Party declared that his group was concerned that the party would remain with Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh, twp means stupid and pwp means shit.
A Member of the Assembly of the Welsh Party commented that the whole group was “disappointed” and has suggested alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said that his group was “open” to changing its name, but noted that the jump from pronunciation of MWP to muppet was small.
In this context, the pronunciation of the letter w in Welsh is similar to the pronunciation of the letter u in English from Yorkshire.
The Commission of the Assembly, which is currently drafting the legislation to introduce the change of name, declares: “Of course, the final decision on any descriptive element of the name of the Members of the Assembly will be a matter for the Members themselves”.
The 2017 Government of Wales Act gave the Assembly of Wales the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals which revealed a broad support for calling the Assembly to Westminster.
On the question of the title of the Members of the Assembly, the Commission preferred Members of the Welsh Parliament (or WMP), but the option MWP obtained the greatest support in a public consultation.
Apparently, the Members of the Assembly are suggesting alternatives, but the fight for reaching a consensus could bring the President of the Assembly, Elin Jones, to a dead end, as she should send the bill on the changes to the Electoral Code to the Council of Ministers in a few weeks.
The legislation on reforms will include other changes related to the functioning of the assembly, such as rules on the disqualification of Members of the Assembly and the design of the committee system.
The members of the Assembly will have the last word on how to name the legislation.
The Macedonians go to the polls to vote on a referendum on the name of the country
The voters will vote on Sunday on whether the name of their country will change to “Republic of Macedonia of the North”.
The popular vote was called in an attempt to resolve a decades-long conflict with the neighboring country, Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has always insisted that the name of its northern neighbor implies a claim to its territory and has repeatedly opposed its candidacy for EU and NATO membership.
The president of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the referendum on the name change, has said he will ignore the vote.
However, the supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change of name is simply the price that must be paid to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's Church are silent because of the difficulties of the churches in Harlem
“Historically, the people I’ve talked to say there was a bar and a church on every corner.”
“Today, there is neither one nor the other.”
He said that the disappearance of bars was understandable.
“Now people socialize in a different way”, says.
“Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhoods that people go to regularly”.
In regard to churches, he is concerned that the money obtained from the sale of goods will not last as long as the leaders expect and that “at some point, they will return to the starting point”.
The churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings filled with the type of people who will not help the churches that are left in the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white people, and, therefore, will accelerate the closure of these churches, since it is unlikely that the majority of people who move to these apartments will be members of these churches.”
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a metropolis: the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and San Martín a decade later.
The white Methodist congregation left in the 1930s.
A black congregation that was holding services in the building acquired it.
A black congregation took over St. Martin's, under the direction of the Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of the merchants on 125th Street, a main shopping street in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote black people.
In 1939, a fire left the building severely damaged and, while the parishioners of Father Johnson were making plans for its reconstruction, they also ordered the bell.
The Reverend David Johnson, son and successor of the Father Johnson in San Martin, was proud to call his campaigns “the campaigns of the poor”.
In July, the expert who played the carillon called: “a cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument”.
In addition, the expert, Tiffany Ng, from the University of Michigan, noted that it was the first carillon in the world used by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who went to play the Riverside Church carillon, the largest, 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather commented that San Martín did not replace him.
What has happened in San Martín in the last months has been a complicated story of architects and contractors, some brought by the lay leaders of the church and others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The parish council, the parish’s rectoral organ, composed of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July commenting on their concern that the diocese “try to pass the costs” to the parish council, although it had not participated in the contracting of the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark attacks 13-year-old boy diving for abalone in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while he was diving for abalone in California on Saturday, the day that the season opened for abalone, according to authorities.
The attack took place shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon’s Beach, in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he and his friends had been diving for about an hour when they heard the boy calling for help, so they swam over to help him.
Hammel commented that, at first, he thought he was just excited about having caught a lobster, but then he realized that he was screaming because he had been bitten
I had my clavicle broken
“I told everyone to get out of the water because there was a shark”, added Hammel.
The child was transported by helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital, where he is in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
The rescuer, Captain Larry Giles, commented in a press conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks before, but that it was not considered a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim showed traumatic injuries in the upper part of the chest.
The authorities closed the access to the beach, from Ponto Beach, in Casablad, to Swami's Beach, in Encinitas, for 48 hours to investigate and for security reasons.
Giles pointed out that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to launch a beauty range in the UK
Sainsbury's buys Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, which have many employees specialized in the aisles of their style and beauty stores.
To stimulate significantly the beauty market in the UK, valued at 2800 billion pounds and with a growth that is increasing in comparison with the fall of sales in fashion and household goods, the biggest beauty halls will be put to the test in 11 shops all over the country and, if they succeed, will be done in more shops the year after.
The investment in beauty arrives at the same time that this chain of supermarkets seeks ways to use the space in shelves that used to be dedicated to televisions, microwaves and home appliances.
Sainsbury's has doubled its beauty offer with up to 3000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
In addition, there will be more space for existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees, with areas similar to those of other stores, such as Boots.
The chain will also relaunch its Boutique makeup line with a majority of products respectful of animals, something that is increasingly demanded by younger customers.
In addition, The Fragrance Shop will also be testing its concessions in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which was recently opened in Croydon, in the south of London, last week. The second will open in Selly Oak, in Birmingham, later this year.
Online shops and the shift towards daily small-quantity food purchases in local shops force supermarkets to try to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, the chief executive of Sainsbury's, has said that the stores will look more like shopping centres as the supermarket chain tries to combat the discount retailers Aldi and Lidl by offering more non-food products and services.
Sainsbury's has integrated Argos discount stores into hundreds of its stores and has introduced several Habitats since its purchase of these chains two years ago. It is considered that this has boosted food sales and has made these acquisitions profitable.
The previous attempt of the chain of supermarkets to renew its beauty and pharmacy departments was a failure.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots at the beginning of the 2000s, but the collaboration ended after a disagreement over how to split the profits from the drugstore products in their supermarkets.
The new strategy is being considered after the sale of the 281 pharmacy stores of Sainsbury to Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
It is noted that Lloyds will participate in the plan, adding a wider range of luxury skin care brands, such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
As Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said: "We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty aisles to make them more appealing to our customers."
In addition, we have invested in a specialized staff that will be available to offer advice.
Our offer of brands is designed to adapt to all needs. On the other hand, a pleasant and comfortable environment makes us an irresistible destination for beauty products, challenging the old way of buying.
Peter Jones is furious after Holly Willoughby breaks a £11 million contract
Peter Jones, the star of Dragon’s Den, went “furious” after Holly Willoughby broke a 11 million pound contract with his lifestyle business to focus on new deals with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time to dedicate to the fashion brand and accessories Truly.
This business had compared with the brand Goop of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The presenter of This Morning, aged 37, announced that she was leaving the business on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has infuriated Peter Jones, the star of Dragon’s Den, by leaving her lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute to focus on her extraordinary new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to the sources consulted, Jones was “furious” when the girl of gold of the television admitted that its new agreements, valued at up to 1.5 million pounds, did not leave time to dedicate to Truly, its fashion and accessories brand, during a tense meeting held on Tuesday in the headquarters of its business empire in Marlow, in Buckinghamshire.
The business had been compared with the brand Goop of Gwyneth Paltrow and it was profiled as favorite to double the fortune of Willoughby, of some 11 million pounds.
While Willoughby, 37, announced that he was leaving the business on Instagram, Jones was leaving Britain to go to one of his holiday homes.
As I commented a source consulted: “Truly was, with no doubt, the main priority of Holly.
It would be her future long-term, which would keep her in the next two decades.
His decision to abandon left everyone involved totally stunned.
Nobody could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of merchandise at Marlow headquarters, ready to be put on the market.
Experts believe that the exit of the presenter of This Morning, one of the most profitable stars in Britain, could cost millions to the company due to the important investment in products such as cushions and candles, and, possibly, delay even more his launch.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, are parents of three children and have been friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby established Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as president in March.
The couples went on vacation together and Jones has a 40 % share in the television production company of Baldwin.
Willoughby is going to become an ambassador for Marks & Spencer and will replace Ant McPartlin as the presenter of I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here on ITV.
A source close to Jones said that last night “no business topics were discussed”.
A difficult conversation “and then we fell in love”
He said he was referring to the media criticism he has received for making a comment that some consider “unpresidential” and for being so positive about North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Why has President Trump renounced so many things?
Trump commented with his mocking voice of “news presenter”.
“I have not renounced anything.”
He said that Kim is interested in meeting again with Trump after Trump praised the first meeting held in June in Singapore, which he considered a big step toward denuclearization of North Korea.
However, the negotiations for nuclear disarmament have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, the principal diplomat of North Korea, Ri Yong Ho, explained to the world leaders gathered at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that his country does not see an “adequate” response from the United States to its first steps toward denuclearization.
On the contrary, he said, the United States continue to apply sanctions in order to maintain pressure.
Trump's perspective was much more optimistic in the speech he gave during his rally.
“We get along great with North Korea,” he said.
“We were going to go to war with North Korea.”
They would have died millions of people.
Now we have a fantastic relationship.
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have generated positive results: the end of missile tests, help for the release of hostages and bringing back the remains of American soldiers home.
In addition, he defended his unusual approach to speaking about relations with Kim.
“It’s very easy to be president, but this way, instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into this stadium full, we’d have 200 people right here.”
A tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastate an island, leaving hundreds dead
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, it was reported to foreign NGOs that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10 % of the population of Lombok had to be displaced, no national emergency was declared, a prerequisite for triggering international aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it clear that they do not want international assistance, which complicates things a little.”
Although Save the Children is preparing a team that will be sent to Palu, they still do not know if the foreign staff can work on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman for the national disaster agency, said the authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see if it was safe for international aid agencies to enter.
Taking into account that the earth is constantly moving in Indonesia, the country is still incredibly unprepared when nature unleashes its fury.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not seen in other coastal areas.
It is likely that the apparent lack of tsunami sirens in Palu, even though there was a prior warning, contributed to the loss of lives.
In the best of cases, traveling from one island of Indonesia to another is a challenge.
Natural disasters make the logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that was in Lombok to treat the victims of the earthquake is heading to Palu, but it will take at least three days to arrive at the new disaster area.
President Joko Widodo has made the improvement of Indonesia's worn-out infrastructure the central axis of his election campaign, and has allocated a lot of money to roads and railways.
Despite the lack of funding, the administration of Mr. Joko has been affected, and he is facing a reelection next year.
In addition, he must face the persistent tensions of sectarianism in Indonesia, where members of the majority Muslim faith have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1000 people died and tens of thousands had to leave their homes while Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets using machetes, bows and arrows, and other rudimentary weapons.
Look at this: Daniel Sturridge, from Liverpool, equalizes the score against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat in the Premier League against Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri at something more than 27 meters from the Chelsea goal when the score was 1-0.
He kicked the ball with his left foot and then he kicked it with his right foot.
The action was sent over the area and went towards the top right corner of the goal.
Finally, the ball passed over Kepa Arrizabalaga who tried to stop it with a jump and fell into the net.
“I was trying to get into that position to get the ball and the players like Shaq always play very advanced, so I tried to give myself all the time possible”, said Sturridge.
“I saw Kante approaching and I gave him a tap. I didn’t think too much about it, I just shot the ball.”
Chelsea was winning 1-0 in the first half after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal in the 25th minute.
The Blues' right-back made a pass to Mateo Kovacic in that play, before turning and making a dribble near the middle of the pitch and entering the Liverpool half.
Kovacic passed the ball quickly and ran in the middle of the field.
After that, he made a beautiful pass to Hazard, who took it to the area.
Hazard is in front of the defense and he scored by kicking the ball to the second post with his left foot, which Alisson Becker, from Liverpool, could not stop.
On Wednesday at 15:00, the Liverpool plays against the Napoli in the phase of groups of the Champions League. The match will be celebrated in the San Paolo Stadium, in Naples (Italy).
On the other hand, Chelsea faces Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3:00 p.m. in London.
The number of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia increases to 832
The number of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has increased to 832, as the Indonesian disaster agency reported at first light on Sunday.
Many people were trapped between the rubble of the buildings that collapsed during the magnitude 7.5 earthquake that occurred on Friday and that triggered waves up to six meters, according to the spokesman of the agency, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho during a press conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with debris from the collapsed buildings.
The police arrest a 32-year-old man as a suspect in the murder of a woman after she was stabbed to death
An investigation into murder has been opened after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The woman of 44 years was found at 7:55 with stab wounds in Grayson Mews, in John Street, which led to the arrest of a 32-year-old man as a suspect for murder.
The police have urged people in the area to report anything they have seen or heard.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in the early stages, but I would encourage anyone who was in the area of John Street, Birkenhead, and who may have seen or heard something suspicious to contact us."
In addition, I would recommend to any person, especially to taxi drivers, that they have been able to capture something in dashcam that contact with us, because they can have vital information for our investigation.
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman whose body was found is from Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
This afternoon some people who think they know the woman arrived at the crime scene to find out where they found her this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and the police have informed that they are in the process of informing the family of the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has tried to get back into his flat, but the police say no one can get in or out of the building.
He was left speechless when he discovered what had happened.
Now, it is informed to the residents that they will be allowed to enter again in a few hours.
Someone heard an agent tell a man that the whole area was being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared in the place in tears.
He keeps repeating “it’s terrible”.
At two o'clock in the afternoon, there were two police vans inside the cordon and one more outside.
Several agents were standing in the cordon inside the building.
We are looking for any person who has information to send an email to DM @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on the number 0800 555 111, registration number 247 from 30 September.
The statue of Cromwell in the Parliament becomes the last commemorative work to rewrite history
Her prohibition would be a poetic act of justice for this destruction of so many cultural and religious objects and artifacts of England carried out by her fanatical Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described the suggestions of Mr. Crick as a “madness” and a “desire to rewrite history”.
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, commented: “In the current debate about the removal of statues, it was inevitable that the figure of Oliver Cromwell from the Palace of Westminster would become a target.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was not ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
It may be that Thomas Cromwell, the wrong Cromwell, sacrifices himself to the Cromwell of the previous century, Thomas, during the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft of Cromwell is a proof of the opinion of the nineteenth century and of part of the historiography of a figure that many consider worthy of celebration.
As the Sunday Telegraph reported, Mr. Goldsmith said: "Many consider Cromwell, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, a defender of the parliament against external pressure, in this case, it is clear, the monarchy."
If it is a completely accurate description, it is a matter of continuing the historical debate.
What is true is that the conflict of the middle of the seventeenth century has given shape to the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure that represents a face of that division.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be celebrated and remembered.
A killer pig attacks a Chinese farmer
A pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southwest China, according to local media.
The man, identified only by his last name “Yuan”, was found dead with an artery cut and covered in blood near a pigsty in Liupanshui, in the province of Guizhou, as the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines into pigs in a pig farm in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
It seems that he traveled with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door of a nearby pigsty was open.
He said that there was a big pig with blood in its mouth in the pigsty.
The forensic examination confirmed that the pig weighing almost 250 kg had attacked the farmer to death, according to the report.
“My cousin’s legs were bloody and broken”, declared the cousin, who goes by the surname Wu, to The Guiyang Evening News.
The images from the security camera showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found approximately an hour after.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told The Evening News that the pig was kept in a pen to prevent it from attacking anyone else, while the police collected evidence at the scene.
It seems that the family of Yuan and the authorities of the market are negotiating a compensation for his death.
Although they are rare, this is not the first time a pig has attacked a person.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man seriously injured.
Ten years ago, a pig weighing almost 295 kilos cornered a farmer in his tractor until his wife scared the animal away.
After pigs ate a rancher in Oregon in 2012, a rancher in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a “disparator”.
“They are only playing.
They are like children, very curious... their intention is not to do harm.
What we need to do is to have them the respect that they deserve.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will leave strong rains in the southwest of the United States.
As expected, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over cooler waters of the northern Mexico coast.
However, Rosa will leave torrential rains over the northern Mexico and the southwest of the United States in the next days.
Rosa caused gusts of wind of more than 136 km/h, a hurricane of category 1, from Sunday at 5:00 a.m. (Eastern Time) and was located about 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia (Mexico).
It is expected that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, in the Pacific Ocean, low pressures are starting to generate, which are moving eastward towards the West Coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday, a tropical storm will start to push the intense tropical rains northward, towards the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will leave more than 25 centimeters of rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Finally, when the tropical rain hits the low pressure that is approaching, there will be heavy rains in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, between 2 and 10 centimeters of rain will cause dangerous flash floods, debris flows and possible rock falls in the desert.
The intense tropical rains will cause precipitation of almost 5 to 8 inches per hour in specific areas, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
Expect between 5 and 10 inches of rain in parts of the southwest, especially in the greater part of Arizona.
Due to the nature of the tropical rain, it is possible that there may be sudden floods with conditions that worsen quickly.
Due to the threat of torrential tropical rains, it is not recommended to go on foot in the desert.
The strong rains could turn the canyons into raging rivers and the storms will cause strong winds and local dust storms.
The low pressures that are approaching will leave strong rains in specific parts of the southern coast of California.
The torrential rains could leave up to two inches of water, which could cause small flows of debris and make the roads slippery.
It would be the first torrential rains of the region during the wet season.
Some tropical showers will approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before becoming widespread by Monday night and Tuesday.
The strong rains will extend to the Four Corners on Tuesday and all day Wednesday.
In October, some intense temperature changes can be observed in the U.S. due to the cooling of the Arctic and the warmth of the tropics.
Sometimes, this implies drastic changes in temperature in short distances.
A good example of these differences in temperature is what will happen in the whole of the U.S. on Sunday.
There will be a difference of almost 7 grados between Kansas City, Missouri and, Omaha (Nebraska), and between St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa).
Over the next few days, the long-lasting heat of the summer will try to recover and expand again.
In a large part of the center and east of the United States, it is expected that the beginning of October will be warm, with temperatures generally ranging from 26 degrees in the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
On Tuesday, in New York, temperatures could reach 26 degrees, 12 degrees above the average.
Our long-term forecast indicates high chances of above-average temperatures for the eastern half of the U.S. during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people followed the harrowing testimonies that Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual assault, gave on Thursday on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political situation continued to be in a deadlock and the media interrupted their regular programming to broadcast the latest news of Friday: a deal designed by the senator of Arizona, Jeff Blake, for the FBI to carry out an investigation for a week.
Ford informed the Senate Judiciary Committee that she has absolute certainty that Kavanaugh groped her in high school and tried to take off her clothes at a party.
During his passionate testimony, Kavanaugh said he was completely sure that that had not happened.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people who commented on Nielsen on Friday have seen it.
The company counted the audience for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not available immediately for other channels that broadcast it, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has some problems to calculate how many people see something in the office.
To put it in perspective, it's a crowd similar to that of a football game or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose commentators have strongly supported Kavanaugh's nomination, fueled the channel leader, with a median of 5.69 million viewers during a hearing that lasted all day, Nielsen said.
ABC occupied the second place, with 3,26 million viewers.
The CBS had 3,1 million, the NBC had 2,94 million, MSNBC had 2,89 million and the CNN had 2,52 million, commented Nielsen.
After the hearing, there was still a great interest.
Flake was the central character of the drama on Friday.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement saying it would vote for Kavanaugh, the morning of Friday, the CNN and CBS cameras caught protesters yelling at him as he tried to get into an elevator to attend a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
While receiving these reproaches, retransmitted live by CNN, he appeared abashed.
“Looking at my face”, said a woman.
“Do you think he is telling the truth to the country?”
And he continued: “you have power when there are so many women who don’t have it”.
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and, before the doors of the elevator closed, that he would have more to say in his appearance before the Commission.
The cable and broadcast television networks were broadcasting everything live hours later, when the Judicial Committee had to vote to propose Kavanaugh's candidacy to the Senate to vote on.
However, Flake said that he would only do it if the FBI investigated the allegations made against the candidate during the next week, which some Democrats have been calling for.
Flake was convinced, in part by the conversations he had had with his friend, the Democratic senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators later, Flake took his decision.
Flake's decision was fundamental, as it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without this investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
The British Prime Minister May accuses her critics of “making politics” with Brexit
Theresa May, the British prime minister, accused her critics of “playing politics” with the future of Britain and undermining the national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
Theresa May, the British prime minister, is due to address the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, England, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview published alongside his on the cover of the newspaper, his former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, insisted on his attack on the supposed Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that a proposal to charge the other side the tariffs was “totally absurd”.
LSU player Wayde Sims shot dead: Dyteon Simpson arrested as suspect
The police have arrested a suspect in the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU, during a shooting.
Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, has been arrested and jailed for a second degree murder charge, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities made public a video of the fight between Sims and Simpson, and the police say that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police recovered the glasses at the crime scene and said they had found DNA of Simpson on them, according to WAFB, a CBS affiliate.
After questioning Simpson, the police say he admitted to having shot Wayde.
A bail of $350,000 has been set, according to the defense.
The East Baton Rouge Parish District Court released a preliminary report Friday that said the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck that had reached the head.
The Department recognizes the merits of the fugitive unit of the Louisiana State Police, the Louisiana State Police Crime Lab, the Southern University Police and the citizens for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, LSU’s athletic director, thanked the police for their diligence and search for justice.
Sims had 20 years.
The player, who was over two meters tall, grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at LSU.
He had obtained a mean of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds in the last season.
On Friday morning, Will Wade, head coach of LSU basketball, declared that his team is “devastated” and “in shock” by the death of Wayde.
“These are the things that people always worry about”, said Wade.
A volcano in Mexico City throws ash into the air
Smoke from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern districts of Mexico City.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexican citizens to stay away from the volcano after it showed activity and emitted 183 gas and ash emissions in 24 hours.
The center registered several tremors and shocks.
In social networks, the images showed thin layers of ash covering the windshields of vehicles in neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
The geophysicists have observed a greater activity in the volcano, located 72 kilometers east of the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck the center of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as “Don Goyo” is active since 1994.
The police face separatists before the Catalan independence referendum
Six people were arrested on Saturday in Barcelona after protesters clashed with police during a demonstration against the Spanish government’s crackdown on Catalan independence.
A group of masked separatists threw eggs and paint powder at the police, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets, which are usually filled with tourists.
Also, there were confrontations in the hours following and the police used truncheons to contain the fight.
For several hours, the independence groups, with messages like “no forgiveness, no forgetting”, faced off against unionists, shouting “Long live Spain”.
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries suffered during the protests, according to local media.
Tensions remain high in this region a year after the October 1, 2017, referendum on independence, considered illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
The voters chose by a landslide majority the independence, although the participation was low, since the people who were against the secession boycotted the referendum in a large measure.
According to Catalan authorities, almost 1000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the vote at polling stations in the whole region, where violent clashes took place.
The groups in favor of independence camped on Friday night to avoid a demonstration in support of the National Police.
The demonstration continued, but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who was attending the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had hopes that Catalonia would become independent.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.”
I saw my parents crying with joy because they could vote, but now we are stuck.
Despite achieving a vital victory in the December regional elections, the pro-Catalan parties have fought to retain the momentum this year, as many of their most prominent leaders, either in exile or in detention, are awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, who recorded the protest in support of the police on his phone, said that the conflict had been inflamed by politicians on both sides.
“It’s getting more and more tense”, he declared.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in preventive detention since the end of last year, announced that he would participate in the European Parliament elections next year.
“To be a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression in democratic values and the repression that we have seen from the Spanish Government”, he said.
Londonderry: men arrested for crashing a house with a car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after repeatedly driving a car into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred on Thursday evening at around 7:30pm in Ballynagard Crescent.
The inspector Bob Blemmings commented that there were damages in the accesses and in the building itself.
At some point, it is possible that the car was shot with a crossbow.
A Menga attack gives Livingston a 1-0 win over Rangers
The first goal of Dolly Menga for Livingston ensured the victory
A Livingston promotion impressed Rangers as Steven Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as Rangers manager.
The attack of Dolly Menga marked the difference. Gary Holt's team went up a place, with the Hibernian in second place.
This season, Gerrard's team have yet to win away from home and next Sunday they face Hearts, leaders of the table with eight points advantage.
Before, the Rangers receive the Rapid Viena on Thursday in the Europa League.
Meanwhile, Livingston extends its winning streak in the division to six games. Holt, the head coach, has yet to taste defeat since replacing Kenny Miller in the month of January.
Livingston lets opportunities pass in front of a tough opponent
The Holt team had to have gone a step ahead much earlier than the Rangers, causing all kinds of problems for the Rangers with their direct play.
Scott Robinson scored a goal, but missed the target in front of the goal. Afterwards, Alan Lithgow's shot was deflected after he had entered the area to score a header.
The home team was content to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause problems for the visitors with their ball-control play.
This is how the decisive goal was scored.
The Rangers gave them a free kick and Livingston looked for an entry, with a combined play of Declan Gallagher and Robinson for Menga, who hit the ball and scored from the center of the area.
In that moment, Rangers dominated the possession, but they couldn't pass the defence of the host and the goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, was quite calm.
The game continues until the second part, although Alfredo Morelos forced a save by Kelly.
Allan McGregor, goalkeeper of Rangers, rejected a shot from Scott Pittman, and Lithgow was far from another play of Livingston.
In the Livingston area, long passes were constantly being played, but they were always cleared. Two penalty appeals were rejected, one after a Halkett header on the substitute Glenn Middleton and another after a handball.
“Fenomenal” of Livingston (analysis)
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A fantastic performance and a fantastic result for Livingston.
The unanimous opinion is that they made an excellent game that exceeded the expectations of a rising trajectory.
His style of play and his team's formation have hardly changed since his promotion, but this is largely due to Holt's efforts to strengthen the team since his arrival.
He had many heroes.
Halkett, the captain of the team, was huge and directed a magnificently organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall alert at all times.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although they had some good moments with Gerrard, they were short.
The Rangers failed to materialize the plays, as they only managed to enter the field once, which is a call to attention to the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan has received an ambiguous welcome in Colonia
On Saturday, September 29, there were smiles and a blue sky during the breakfast of the leaders of Turkey and Germany in Berlin.
It is the last day of the controversial visit of the Turkish president to Germany, with the aim of restoring the relations between the allies of NATO.
They have discussed issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
After that, Erdogan went to Colonia to inaugurate a new huge mosque.
The city hosts the largest population of Turks outside of Turkey.
The police alleged security reasons to prevent 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many sympathizers gathered in the vicinity to see their president.
Also, hundreds of opponents of Erdogan, much of them Kurds, condemned both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to receive him in the country.
These demonstrations reflect the divisive nature of this visitor, welcomed as a hero by some German Turks and considered an autocrat by others.
Accident in Deptford: cyclist dies after colliding with a car
A cyclist has died in a car accident in London.
The accident happened near the intersection of Bestwookd Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road to the east of the city, at 10:15.
The driver of the car stopped and the cyclist was attended by the paramedics, but he died there.
The accident happened after a cyclist died after being hit by a car that fled the scene in Childers Street, almost two kilometres from the scene of the Saturday accident.
The Metropolitan Police said that the officers were working to identify the man and inform his family.
Roads have been cut and buses have been diverted, and it has been advised to drivers to avoid the area.
Six prison officers injured in disturbance at Long Lartin
Six prison guards have been injured in a fight in a high security prison for men, according to the director of the prison.
The disturbances started in the prison of Long Lartin, in Worcestershire, at 9:30 on Sunday and still continue.
Specialists of an elite team (called “Tornado”) are in charge of controlling the fights, in which eight patients and eight staff members are involved.
The agents received assistance for light facial injuries at the location.
A spokesman for the prison service says: “Specialist staff have been deployed to deal with the incident at Long Lartin prison.”
Six members of staff have received medical assistance.
In our prisons, violence is not tolerated and we make it clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and could spend more time in jail.
Long Lartin prison holds more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was reported that the director of the prison had received medical assistance after a prisoner attacked him.
In addition, in October last year, agents of the anti-disturbance squad were called to the prison to deal with a serious incident in which the prison staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (arid regions could benefit)
It is unusual for a tropical depression to reach Arizona, but that is exactly what could happen at the beginning of next week when the last remnants of Hurricane Rosa cross the southwest desert, with the risk of sudden floods.
The National Meteorological Service has already issued alerts for flash floods for Monday and Tuesday in the western Arizona, southern Nevada, eastern California and southeastern Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will drive directly to Phoenix on Tuesday, leaving rain behind at the end of the Monday.
The National Meteorological Service of Phoenix commented in a tweet that only "ten hurricanes had maintained their tropical storm or depression status within a 321 kilometer radius of Phoenix since 1950."
In 1967, Hurricane Katrina approached almost 65 kilometers from the border of Arizona.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict between 5 and 10 inches of torrential rains, which can reach up to 15 inches in isolated areas of the Mogollon Rim, in Arizona.
It is likely that between 2 and 5 inches of rain will fall, with the possibility of reaching 10 inches in isolated areas, in other parts of the southwest desert, including the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin.
In places that are not at risk of sudden floods, Rosa's rains are considered a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Although a flood is a very serious matter, it is likely that part of these torrential rains will be beneficial due to the drought conditions currently being experienced in the southwest.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40% of Arizona is suffering from extreme drought, the second highest category, as reported by weather.com.
First of all, the hurricane Rosa will hit the Baja California peninsula.
Rosa, which will still have a hurricane force with maximum winds of 136 mph on Sunday morning, is 619 miles south of Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and is moving north at 19 mph.
The storm is finding cooler waters in the Pacific, so it is losing strength.
As such, it is expected that the storm will intensify to a hurricane along the coast of Mexico by the afternoon of Monday.
Heavy rains could fall in some parts of Mexico, which are at risk of flooding.
“Se expect heavy rains of between 7 and 15 inches from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with the possibility of reaching 25 inches.”
After Rosa heads north towards Mexico as a tropical storm, she will arrive at the Arizona border in the early morning hours of Tuesday as a tropical depression. Later, she will move south towards Utah by the end of the night on Tuesday.
“The main danger of Rosa or its remains is the strong torrential rain in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the southwest of the US desert.”
It is expected that these rains will cause dangerous flash floods and sudden flows of debris in the deserts, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested as suspects in a stabbing after a 16-year-old boy was found with knife wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the area of Excelsior Terrace, in Midsomer Norton, around 4:00 on Saturday.
He was transferred to a hospital, where he remains “stable”.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and one 20-year-old were arrested that same night in the Radstock area, according to the police in Somerset.
The agents have made a call to anyone who may have recorded what happened with the mobile.
Trump says Kavanaugh “suffered the meanness and anger” of the Democratic Party
“Voting for Judge Kavanaugh is voting to reject the despicable tactics and unfair treatment of the Democrat Party,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has suffered the meanness and anger of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before the Congress on Thursday, denying the accusation of Christine Blasey Ford in a very emotional and emphatic way that he had sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Likewise, Ford testified in the session about this accusation.
On Saturday, the president said that, that day, the “American people saw the cunning, the quality and the bravery” of Kavanaugh.
“Voting to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is voting to confirm a judge with the most impressive legal record of our day, a judge with an admirable record of service to the public.”
The president made indirect references to Kavanaugh's candidacy in speaking of the importance of Republican participation in midterm elections.
“There are only five weeks left until one of the most important elections of our lives.”
I didn’t attend, but I did take the course.
“That’s why I go from one place to another fighting to get great candidates.”
Trump alleged that the Democrats are embarked on a mission of “resistance and obstruction”.
It is expected that the first key vote in the Senate on the nomination of Kavanaugh will take place no later than Friday, according to a high-ranking Republican official.
Hundreds of dead in a quake and tsunami in Indonesia, the number is increasing
At least 384 people have died and many have been swept away by the enormous waves that ravaged the beaches after a strong earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, as reported by the authorities.
Hundreds of people had gathered to celebrate a festival on the beach of the city of Palu when waves of up to six meters arrived at night, dragging many to their death and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami occurred after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
“When it was announced yesterday that a tsunami could occur, people were still on the beach and did not leave immediately, so they were victims,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the National Agency for Disaster Management (BNPB, for its Indonesian acronym) in a press conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami did not come alone, it brought cars, trees, houses, it destroyed everything that was on the ground”, said Nugroho. The tsunami had moved across the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
He also added that some people had climbed trees to escape the tsunami and had survived.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The aerial photographs published by the agency showed the destruction of many buildings and shops, broken bridges and collapsed, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The replicas were still hitting the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes felt in a region with 2,4 millions of people.
The Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT, for its Indonesian acronym) informed in a press release that the energy released by the great earthquake of Friday was 200 times greater than the atomic bomb that fell on Hiroshima in the Second World War.
He added that the geography of the city, which is located at the end of a long and narrow bay, could have magnified the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damages as “serious” and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
According to what he said, they found bodies of some victims trapped under the debris of the destroyed buildings. In addition, 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the number of victims and the damage could be greater along the 300 km of coast to the north of Palu, a zone called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications were totally paralyzed and there was no information about Donggala
“More than 300,000 people live there”, said the Red Cross in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy in itself, but it could be much worse.”
On Saturday, the agency received many criticisms for not informing about the tsunami that had hit Palu, although the authorities claim that the waves had already reached the coast when the alert was issued.
In a recording captured by an amateur and shared on social networks, you can hear a man who was on the last floor of a building warning people in the street that a tsunami was approaching.
In a matter of minutes, a wall of water hits the coast, sweeping away buildings and cars.
Reuters could not verify the material immediately.
The earthquake and the tsunami caused a great blackout that cut communications in the surrounding areas of Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army started to send cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but the evacuees still need food and other basic products.
The airport of the city has been reopened only for emergency and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has a scheduled visit to the evacuation centers of Paul on Sunday.
The number of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia is higher than 800.
It's a very bad thing.
Although the staff of World Vision in Donggala have arrived safely in Palu, where the employees are sheltering under tarpaulins installed in the garden of their offices, they have seen a devastating scene on their way, said the Mr. Doseba.
“They told me they had seen many houses destroyed”, commented.
It's a very bad thing.
Even as the groups of aid were putting the gears of assistance in motion, some people were lamenting that it was not being allowed the movement of aid workers with wide experience.
According to the Indonesian regulation, only foreign aid, supplies and deployment of foreign personnel can be used in the affected area if the area is declared a national disaster zone.
And that has not yet happened.
“It is still a disaster at the provincial level”, said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the Government says that it considers it a national disaster, we can start to provide international aid, but it has not happened yet.”
After the second night in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami of Friday, friends and relatives of the people who were still missing still had the hope that their loved ones would be the miracles that would bring some light to the stories that write natural disasters.
On Saturday, a small child was pulled out of a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days next to the body of her mother.
Gendon Subandono, instructor of the national parapente team of Indonesia, had trained two of the missing parapentists for the Asian Games, which ended this month in Indonesia.
Other than those who were trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, Mr. Mandagi included, were his students.
“For my experience in the field of paragliding, I carry my own emotional load”, commented.
The gentleman Gendon remembered how, in the hours that followed the announcement of the collapse of the hotel Roa Roa in the community of parapente, he had sent desperate messages to the competitors of Palu, who were participating in the festival that was being held on the beach.
However, his messages only showed a grey verification mark, not two in blue.
“I think that means that the messages weren’t delivered”, said.
Thieves steal $26,750 during a cash reload at Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, some thieves robbed a Brink employee who was refilling an ATM at Newport on the Levee, taking $26,750, according to a police department news release.
The driver of the vehicle had emptied a cash machine located in the center of entertainment and was preparing to recharge it with more money, wrote the detective Dennis McCarthy in the note.
While I was busy, another man “came running up behind the employee of Brink” and stole a bag of money destined for reloading.
According to the note, there are witnesses who saw several suspicious people leaving the place, but the police did not specify the number of suspects involved in the incident.
Any person who has information about the identities of these individuals should contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: the rapper changes his name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West will start calling himself Ye.
Kanye West announced the change on Twitter on Saturday: “The person previously known as Kanye West”.
It has been a long time since West, 41 years old, was called Ye, the name he used as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes before its appearance on Saturday Night Live, where it is expected to present his new album, Yandhi.
Replacing the singer Ariana Grande, who had to cancel her performance for “emotional reasons”, as the creator of the program commented.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his professional name, West had previously said that the word had a religious importance for him.
“I think it’s the most used word in the Bible, which means ‘you’,” commented West in the early part of this year while speaking about the title of the album with the radio host Big Boy.
“I am you, I am us, it means us.
Kanye West is no longer ‘the only one’, he is now ‘Ye’, a reflection of our good, bad and confusing things, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are.
One of the many famous rappers who has changed his name.
Sean Combs has been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
An old collaborator of West, JAY-Z, has used his name in capital or small letters, with or without guillemets.
The Mexican AMLO promises not to use the army against the population
Andrés Manuel López Obrador, the newly elected Mexican president, has promised never to use the army against the civilian population, now that he is approaching the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students in the country.
On Saturday, López Obrador promised in Plaza Tlatelolco that “he would never use the army to repress the people of Mexico”.
On October 2, 1968, the troops fired on a peaceful demonstration in the plaza, killing 300 people at a time when student movements were strengthening throughout Latin America.
López Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by giving them monthly subsidies for studying and opening more free public universities.
He affirmed that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities led young people to join criminal gangs.
The U. S. should double its funding for I. A.
Now that China is more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double its investment in research in this field, says Kai-Fu Lee, investor and professional of I. A. who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after the announcements of several parts of the U.S. Government, even when, in general, the U.S. lacks an official I.A. strategy.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: its goal is to become the number 1 in innovation in I A. by 2030.
“Doubling the budget for research on I. A. would be a good start, given that all other countries are lagging behind the U.S. We are looking to the future and the next step in the field of I. A.”, says Lee.
The doubling of funding means the doubling of the chances that the next great achievement in I. A. will be achieved in the U.S., as Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by the Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the executive director of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most important I. A. companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on a system that defeated the best American player of Othello. Later, he was an executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China office.
Lee acknowledged the previous technological competitions of the U.S. government, such as the DARPA Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be, which would identify the next generation of visionaries.
In the U.S., researchers have to work hard to get government funding, commented Lee.
“It’s not China that’s taking the leaders of academia; it’s the corporations,” Lee said.
In the last years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired top graduates from the universities to work in I. A.
Lee commented that some changes in U.S. immigration policy could also help intensify U.S. initiatives in I. A.
“I think that doctors in I. A. should have automatic permanent residency cards,” he said.
The State Council of China presented its Plan for the Development of the Next Generation of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
The National Natural Science Foundation of China funds people from academic institutions as well as other government organizations, just like the National Science Foundation and other government agencies fund researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, commented Lee.
At the beginning of this year, the Department of Defense of the United States established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, whose purpose is to attract partners from the industrial and academic sectors. On the other hand, the White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, this month DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in a program called AI Next.
As far as the National Science Foundation is concerned, it currently invests more than 100 million USD per year in research on I. A.
Meanwhile, the US legislation that aimed to create a National Commission on Artificial Intelligence Security has not taken any action for months.
The Macedonians decided in a referendum whether they will change the name of their country
The people of Macedonia decided in a referendum on Sunday on whether their name will change to “Republic of Macedonia of the North”, a gesture that would resolve a decades-long conflict with Greece, which had blocked its application for EU membership and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbor is a claim to its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, both governments reached an agreement on the new name proposed, but the nationalists argue that the change would diminish the ethnic identity of the Macedonian population, the majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has cast doubt on whether the participation will reach the 50 % minimum required to make the referendum valid.
In the referendum ballot, the following question was asked: “Are you in favor of the accession to NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?”
The supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to help Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the disintegration of Yugoslavia, to try to join bodies like the EU and NATO.
“I have come to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live in freedom under the protection of the European Union, because this means a safer life for all”, said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopie.
Although it will not be legally binding, many members of the Parliament have said that they will respect the result of the vote so that it will be decisive.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in the Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission declared that, at one o'clock in the afternoon, no irregularities had been reported.
However, participation was only 16 %, compared with the 34 % of the last elections to the European Parliament held in 2016, when 66 % of registered voters cast their votes.
“I have come to vote for my children, our place is in Europe”, declared Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in Skopie.
Zoran Zaev, Prime Minister of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and son Dushko deposited their vote in the referendum on the name change of Macedonia that would open the way for the country to join NATO and the EU in Strumica (Macedonia) on September 30, 2018.
In front of the Parliament, in Skopie, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54 years old, was preparing a small stage and removing chairs from the tents in front of the campaign booths that were going to boycott the referendum.
“We are in favor of joining NATO and the EU, but we want to do it with our heads held high, not by the back door,”
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.”
If they don’t want us to enter as Macedonia, we can establish relations with other countries, like China and Russia, and become part of the Euro-Asian integration.
The Prime Minister Zaev says that the accession to NATO would bring the investment that Macedonia so much needs, whose unemployment rate is over 20 %
“I believe that the majority will be in favour, as more than 80% of citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO”, said Zaev after depositing his vote.
He said that a positive result would be a “confirmation of our future”.
In a survey published on Monday by the Institute for Public Policies, it was assured that between 30 and 43 % of voters were going to participate in the referendum, which means a lower participation than the required.
Another survey conducted by Telma TV, from Macedonia, revealed that 57 % of the respondents were planning to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote in favour.
To make the referendum a success, the participation must be of 50 % plus one vote.
In case of failure, it would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western policy of the government since it came to power in May last year.
Look at this: Sergio Agüero, from Manchester City, evades the whole defense of Brighton to score a goal
Sergio Agüero and Raheem Sterling scored the goals that Manchester City won 2-0 against Brighton in the Etihad Stadium of Manchester (England).
For Agüero, it was ridiculously easy to score a goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentinian midfielder received a pass in the middle of the field at the beginning of the play.
He ran between three defenders of Brighton before entering the open field.
Once there, he saw himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He evaded a defender before beating several more in the area of Brighton.
He made a pass to the left, where Sterling was.
The English striker used his first touch in the area to return the ball to Agüero, who hit it with his right foot to avoid Mathew Ryan with a shot that reached the right side of the goal.
“Agüero has some problems in his foot”, said Pep Guardiola, City’s coach, to the press.
“We are talking about a game that would last between 55 and 60 minutes.
That was what happened.
We were lucky to score a goal at that moment.
However, it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League title race.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
In that play, Agüero received the ball very deep in the Brighton territory.
He made a beautiful pass to the left wing for Leroy Sane.
Sane gave some touches before directing Sterling towards the second post.
The striker of the Sky blues shot the ball just before leaving the pitch.
The City faces the Hoffenheim in a group stage match of the Champions League on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim (Germany).
Scherzer wants to spoil the party for the Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from the playoff race, there was no reason to force another opening.
Even so, the always competitive Scherzer is expected to step on the mound on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if these, won against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the West Division of the National League, still have chances in the playoffs.
The Rockies secured at least a wildcard spot thanks to a 5-2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but still seek their first division title.
“Even though we’re not playing for anything, at least we can kick the ball with the certainty that the Denver crowd will be excited and that the other team will probably be playing at the highest level I’ve faced this year.”
Why wouldn’t he want to participate?”
The Nationals still have to announce a starter for Sunday, but it seems they are leaning towards starting Scherzer in that situation.
Scherzer, who will make his opening number 34, made a practice session on Thursday and will return to his normal rest on Sunday.
The history of the Washington's right-handed pitcher is of 18 victories and 7 defeats, with an ERA of 2,53 and 300 strikeouts with 2/3 in 220 entered.
Trump gives a speech in West Virginia
The president made indirect references to the situation surrounding Brett Kavanaugh, his selection for the Supreme Court, when he spoke about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
“In November everything is at stake.”
There are five weeks left until one of the most important elections of our lives.
It is one of the most important. I do not present myself, but it is a race, so I go from one place to another fighting for great candidates.
And he continued: “We have this terrible radical group of Democrats, it’s happening right now.”
They are determined to recover power by all means necessary, you can see the meanness, the wickedness.
They don’t care who they hurt or who they have to step on to get power and control, that’s what they want, power and control. And we’re not going to give it to them.
The Democrats, he said, are embarked on a mission of “resistance and obstruction”.
“We have seen these last four days”, he said, saying that the Democrats were “angry, bad, horrible and false”.
He made reference to the Senate Judiciary Committee nominating Senator Dianne Feinstein, who received boos from the audience.
“Do you remember his answer?”
Do you filter the document?
Mmm, Mmm, What?
No, no mmm, I hope for a response. His body language was terrible, the worst I've ever seen.
The Labour Party already covers a wide range of opinions.
He is intolerant with people who say what they think
When the activists of my local Momentum party voted to censure me, I was hardly surprised.
After all, I am the last of a line of Labour MPs who are told that we are not welcome, and only for saying what we think.
My colleague in the Parliament, Joan Ryan, received a treatment that is categorically against antisemitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticized me for not being in agreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
I was in disagreement with the importance of a responsible economic policy, in terms of national security, on Europe. It is ironic that Jeremy was in disagreement with leaders on issues on which he was in disagreement with previous leaders.
As was made clear in the notice of the meeting of the Nottingham East Labour Party on Friday, “we want meetings to be inclusive and productive”.
During the greater part of the eight years that I have been a Member of the Labour Party in this constituency, that is exactly what the Friday night meetings of the General Committee have been.
Unfortunately, this is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of a “more friendly and compassionate” policy has already been forgotten, if it ever really applied in any way.
It is becoming clearer that the Labour Party is intolerant of differing opinions and that each opinion is judged in terms of whether the party leaders consider it acceptable or not.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues with whom he had previously shared a political vision started to expect him to change his views radically and to adopt positions with which he had never been in agreement, whether on security or on the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public, regardless of what I say, there is a barrage of insults on social media demanding my resignation, denouncing the policies of the center, telling me that I should not be in the Labour Party.
I am not the only one who has experienced it.
Indeed, I know that I am luckier than some of my colleagues, since the comments about me tend to be political.
I am amazed by the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face a daily torrent of sexist or racist insults, but never run away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the normalization of insults.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer have that wide range of opinions and, with each motion “of censorship” or each change in the selection rules, the party becomes more narrow.
In the last two years, I have received many advices that recommended me to keep my head down and not to make myself heard too much and that way “I would be fine”.
But I haven't got into politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, as a student, I have been motivated by the neglect of the Thatcher government which left my secondary school in ruins, and I have tried to support improvements in public services for those who need them most, whether as a councillor or as a minister in government.
I have never hidden my political ideas, not even in the last elections.
It is impossible that someone in Nottingham East did not know my political positions and the areas in which I did not agree with the current leaders.
I would say to those who promoted the motion of Friday is that I do not understand these desires to lose time and energy with questions about my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party when the country is going headlong to a Brexit that will affect homes, businesses and public services.
The real message is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for the voters, be they Labour or not: I am proud to serve them and I promise that no threat of withdrawal or opportunistic politics will stop me from acting according to what I believe is best for all of you.

Ayr 38 - Melrose 17: Ayr remain unbeaten at the top of the table
Two late tries may have decided the final result, but, without doubt, Ayr deserved the victory in this entertaining match of the Tennent’s Premiership.
Now they lead the table and are the only undefeated team of the ten that participate.
In the end, it was the superiority of their defense, as well as their ability to take advantage of better opportunities, which gave them the victory, so the coach Peter Murchie had every right to be happy.
“We have been put to the test in all the games and we are still undefeated, so I have to be happy.”
Robyn Christie, from Melrose, commented: “Ayr deserve the recognition, they took their chances better than us”.
Grant Anderson's try in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead; but a yellow card for Rory Hughes, on loan from Warriors, allowed Melrose to take advantage of the numerical disadvantage and Jason Baggot scored an unconverted try.
The Ayr increased the lead with a penalty. Before, just in the middle time, he scored and converted a solo try, which left the score at 17-5 in favor of the Ayr in the break.
However, the Melrose started well in the second half and Patrick Anderson's essay, converted by Baggot, reduced this difference to five points.
After that there was a long interruption due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who had to be carried off on a stretcher, and, when the game resumed, Ayr took the lead with a try converted by Climo.
The yellow card to Blair Macpherson, captain of the Ayr, allowed the Melrose to take advantage of having one more man on the pitch, at the end of a period of great pressure.
However, the locals recovered and, when the yellow card was shown to Struan Hutchinson for placating Climo without the ball, from the line of the maul, MacPherson made a try when he was in the back of the maul that was advancing.
The weather converted him, as he had been doing almost since the game resumed, after Kyle Rowe received the ball from David Armstrong's kick and sent Gregor Henry to the corner for his fifth penalty attempt.
The protagonist of Still Game wants to orient his career towards the restaurant sector
Ford Kieran, the star of Still Game, seems determined to move into the restaurant business after revealing he has been named director of a chain of restaurants.
The actor of 56 years is Jack Jarvis in the famous program of the BBC, who writes and coprotagonizes with his partner of many years, Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the ninth season will be the last, and it seems that Kiernan is making plans for his life after Craiglang.
According to the official register, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the matter, although a source from the Scottish Sun claimed that Kiernan wanted to get involved in the “booming” Glasgow restaurant scene.
“The sea is ours”: a Bolivia without a coastline has the hope that the court will reopen the route to the Pacific
The sailors watch a naval headquarters in La Paz.
In public buildings, blue flags wave.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the naval bases show the motto: “The sea is ours by right,
Recovering it is a duty.
In all Bolivia, a land without sea, they still remember vividly the lost coast before Chile in a bloody conflict over the resources that took place in the 19th century, as well as the longing to sail the Pacific Ocean again.
Bolivia may have the greatest hopes in decades, as the International Court of Justice is expected to rule on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the impulse, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, is waiting for the result with a positive vision”, said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the International Court of Justice ruling on the sea border dispute with Chile on large screens spread throughout the country, with the hope that the Hague court will rule in favor of Bolivia's claim that, after decades of intermittent negotiations, Chile has the obligation to negotiate to grant Bolivia a sovereign exit to the sea.
Bolivian President Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous leader who is fighting a controversial battle for reelection next year, also has much to say about the resolution passed on Monday.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will rule in Bolivia's favor and that the situation would change little if it did.
The UN agency based in the Netherlands has no power to adjudicate territory of Chile and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of any possible negotiations.
The fact that the International Court of Justice’s resolution comes only six months after the final arguments indicates that the case was not complicated, said Chilean expert Paz Zárate.
Bolivia's cause may have been hindered by the last four years.
“The problem of access to the sea has been seized by the current Bolivian administration”, said Zárate.
In addition, he suggested that the bellicose rhetoric of Morales has undermined any residual goodwill between Chile and Bolivia.
Bolivia and Chile will continue talking, but it will be extremely difficult to maintain conversations after this.
The two countries do not exchange ambassadors since 1962.
The former president of Bolivia, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, rejected the idea that the court's decision would be unusually quick.
On Monday, Bolivia will offer Chile “an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile” and the possibility of “putting an end to 139 years of disputes with mutual benefits”, said.
In addition, Calzadilla denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, used the maritime issue as a political weapon.
“Bolivia will never renounce its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean”, he added.
“The resolution is an opportunity to see what we have to leave behind.”
North Korea says it will not give up nuclear weapons unless it can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never be the first to give up its nuclear weapons if it cannot trust Washington.
He spoke on Saturday before the General Assembly of the United Nations.
The United States was urged to keep its promises made during a summit in Singapore between the rivals.
Mike Pompeo, the U.S. Secretary of State, seems to be on the verge of re-starting diplomatic talks on nuclear issues with North Korea, which have been stalled for more than three months since this summit with Kim Jong U, the leader of North Korea.
The speaker said that the continuation of the sanctions and the opposition of the United States to a declaration that ends the Korean War, is a “quixotic” dream.
Washington shows reluctance to accept the declaration without North Korea making a significant disarmament move first.
Both Kim and the president of the United States, Donald Trump, want to celebrate another summit.
However, there is a widespread skepticism about North Korea's seriousness about giving up its nuclear arsenal, which it probably considers as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo has planned to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for another summit between the leaders.
The Paris fashion shows reveal the latest line of enormous hats that are about to land in a shop near you
If you want to increase your collection of hats or protect yourself from the sun, you don't have to look any further.
The designers of Valentino and Thom Browne presented a collection of eccentric hats for their spring-summer 2019 collection on the catwalk, dazzling the style of the Paris Fashion Week.
The impossible hats have flooded Instagram this summer and these designers have brought their spectacular creations to the catwalk.
The most outstanding piece of Valentino was a beige hat with a wide brim adorned with feathers that covered the heads of the models.
Other large accessories were pineapples with jewels, a wizard's hat, and even a pineapple, but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of strange masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn lips and reminded me more of Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
One creation recalled a complete diving team, including snorkel and goggles, while another seemed like a melted ice cream cone.
If you like the fashion of large size, you are lucky.
The hat hunters predict that the huge hats could start to be seen in the streets of shops.
The big hats are coming stomping with the hand of “La Bomba”, with a straw hat with an ala of more than 60 centimeters used by all, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand that presented this impractical hat that flooded the social networks with a great creation in the catwalk: a beach bag as big as the model in bikini that carried it.
The raffia bag in dark orange, decorated with raffia and with a white leather handle, was the main piece of the Jacquemus La Riviera collection for the spring-summer 2019 season in Paris Fashion Week.
As fashion stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I hope to see huge beach bags and hats on the streets this summer. As the designer has had a big impact, it would be hard to ignore the demand for big accessories”.
John Edward: the linguistic skills are fundamental for the citizens of the world
The independent schools in Scotland have a long history of academic excellence that has continued in 2018 with another set of exceptional results in the exams that is reinforced by the individual and collective successes in the fields of sport, art, music and other community projects.
With more than 30,000 students in all of Scotland, these centres, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS, for its English acronym), are committed to delivering the highest level of service to students and parents.
Independent schools have as their object to prepare their pupils for further education, for the career they choose and for the place they occupy in the world.
As a sector of education that can design and implement an adapted curriculum, it is observed that modern languages are still a popular and desired subject in the centres.
As Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, the message goes to his head. If you talk to him in his language, the message goes to his heart.”
If you speak to him in his language, it reaches his heart.
This is a powerful reminder that, if you want to establish relationships and generate trust with people from other countries, you can't depend only on English.
If we take into account the recent results of the exams of this year, we can observe that the languages are in the highest places of the classification tables, being the approval rates of the independent schools the highest.
In total, 68 % of the students who studied foreign languages obtained an A, the highest grade.
The data, collected from the 74 centers that make up the SCIS, showed that 72 % of students obtained an A in Mandarin, while 72 % of students studying German, 69 % of students studying French, and 63 % of students studying Spanish also obtained an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support the teaching of foreign languages because they are a fundamental skill that children and young people will need in the future without a doubt.
In the current situation, it is considered that, as an optional subject, languages are at the same level as the subjects CTIM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the study plans of independent schools and everywhere.
A survey carried out in 2014 by the Commission for Employment and Skills in the United Kingdom revealed that, of the reasons given by employers on the difficulties they faced in filling vacancies, 17 % were attributed to the lack of linguistic skills.
Therefore, linguistic competences are becoming more and more indispensable for preparing young people for their future careers.
The opportunities for employment that require language skills are increasing, so these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career someone chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future thanks to this competition, which will last a lifetime.
The fact that you can communicate directly with people from foreign countries will allow you to get ahead of the competition.
According to a survey conducted by YouGov among more than 4000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75% of them did not speak any foreign language well enough to hold a conversation. It was also established that the only language spoken by a percentage of two digits, the 15%, was French.
For this reason, investing in the teaching of languages now is important for children today.
If you know several languages, especially those of developing economies, children will be better equipped to find a quality job.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Some centres will focus on the classical modern languages, while others will teach the languages considered most important for the United Kingdom in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interests of a child, in independent schools, he can choose between several languages taught by specialist teachers.
The independent schools in Scotland dedicate all their efforts to providing a learning environment that prepares children for life and equips them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever their future holds.
In these times, it is undeniable that, in a global business environment, languages still have an important role to play for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages must be considered “competencies for international communication”.
The independent schools will continue to offer these options, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
It's necessary to do it.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Independent Schools Council
LeBron James makes his debut with the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait of the fans who are waiting to see LeBron James debut in his first game with Los Angeles Lakers is about to end.
Luke Walton, head coach of the Lakers, announced that James will play the opening game of the preseason against the Denver Nuggets on Sunday in San Diego.
However, it is still not clear how many minutes he will play.
“It will be more than one and less than 48”, Walton said on the official Lakers website.
The Lakers reporter, Mike Trudell, tweeted that it was likely that James would play a limited number of minutes.
After a training session at the beginning of this week, James was asked about his plans for the six-game preseason schedule of the Lakers.
“In this stage of my career I don’t need preseason games to prepare myself,” he said.
Trump's rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of the five Trump rallies scheduled for next week, including stops in places with supporters, like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote of confirmation of his candidate to cover the vacancy of the Supreme Court in waiting, Trump intends to obtain support for the next elections in the middle of the period, since the Republicans run the risk of losing control of the Congress when the votes are deposited in November.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight and how can it be watched online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7:00 PM this evening, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch it online through a live broadcast on YouTube.
It is likely that Trump will comment on this week's hearings of the Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, which were tense due to sexual misconduct allegations and have left the Senate in limbo for, at most, a week while the FBI investigates.
However, the main objective of this series of rallies is to help Republicans who are facing the elections in November to gain momentum.
So, the Trump campaign signaled that the five rallies next week are meant to “energize volunteers and supporters while Republicans try to protect and expand their majorities in the Senate and House,” according to Reuters.
“The control of Congress is so crucial to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible while we are in the campaign,” said a Trump campaign spokesman, who declined to be named.
The programed event in the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling tonight could attract sympathizers from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as having coverage in the media of Pittsburgh.
The Saturday will be the second time in a month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state in which he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, the Republican candidate for Senate in West Virginia, who is trailing in the polls.
“For Morrisey, it’s not a good sign that the president has to come to give him a push in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: the U.S. team shows that it is willing to fight to keep alive the hope of facing the individual matches on Sunday.
After three individual sessions, the foursomes on Saturday afternoon may be what this Ryder Cup needed.
The pendulum swing is a completely invented concept, but the players believe in it, even more so in competitions like these.
So, where would they say the impulse is now?
“We were six points behind and now we are four points behind, so I guess that’s a little bit of a push,” said Jordan Spieth after the round.
Europe has the advantage, of course: four points ahead with twelve more in play.
As Spieth points out, Americans feel they have a bit of a wind at their backs and plenty of reasons to be optimistic, among other reasons because Spieth and Justin Thomas played together all day and earned four points out of four.
Spieth has been deadly off the tee and preaches with example.
The guttural cries of celebration rose in volume as their round progressed, introducing a vital putt for a tie for the fourth round when they were two down after two holes.
The putt that gave the game to the US in the 15th was received with a similar cry, those that transmit that the US team is not yet out.
“What we need to do is redouble our efforts and concentrate on the game”, commented Spieth.
That's what these players have done.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed history of the Ryder Cup.
The strange and adorable couple of Europe has won four of four and nothing can go wrong.
“Moliwood” was the only couple that did not make a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday evening and in the last nine holes of Friday morning.
That's the way they play and the way they flow with the noisy crowd makes clear that these are the players to beat on Sunday, and that there won't be any other players as popular as Fleetwood and Molinari to seal a possible European victory when the sun sets at Le Golf National.
Preferably, both at the same time in different holes.
Even so, it is premature to speak of European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson dispatched Sergio García, the hero of the four-ball in the morning, after forming a partnership with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two double bogeys on the first nine holes buried the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole from which they could not escape.
But on Sunday there will be no help to get out of the holes.
The fourballs and foursomes are fascinating to watch because you can see the interactions between the couples, the advice they give and the advice they don't give, and the way a strategy can change in an instant.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and has a big lead going into the last day, but this foursomes session also showed that the U.S. team is willing to fight, something that some, especially Americans, doubted.
Europe leads by 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe has a good advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup, after finishing the fourballs and foursomes with a result of 10-6 over the United States.
The motivated duo composed by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the competition with two victories over Tiger Woods who was in trouble, advancing four points in the classification of Le Golf National.
The European Thomas Bjorn, trying to keep the trophy they lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated a team that committed many errors during the morning fourballs, which ended 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursomes, winning two matches, but failed to close the gap.
The American Jim Furyk needs to obtain eight points from the 12 individual games on Sunday to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row. In addition, he and Molinari, who received the nickname “Molliwood” after a sensational weekend, are the second pair to win four points in their first four matches in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After losing to Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, their magnificent union served to beat a despondent Woods and a rookie American Bryson DeChambeau by a resounding 5-4.
Woods, who in the two matches of Saturday did not stand out much, had occasional flashes of brilliance, but now he has lost 19 of his 29 fourballs and foursomes, and seven consecutive.
Justin Rose, who was rested for the morning fourballs, returned to be the partner of Henrik Stenson in the foursomes, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, number one and number three in the world respectively, with a result 2-1.
Although the day was pleasant and tranquil in the southwest of Paris, Europe did not have everything on its side.
The three-time winner, Jordan Spieth, and Justin Thomas served as reference for the Americans, obtaining two points on Saturday.
They won an exciting 2-1 victory over Ian Poulter and Spanish Jon Rahm in the fourballs and then defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy by 4-3 in the foursomes after losing the two initial holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, that a team has recovered from a four point deficit in the individual matches has only happened twice, although Furyk, as the holder of the trophy, only needs a draw to keep it.
Although they have been the second best for two days, it seems that carrying out a counterattack on Sunday is beyond their capabilities.
North Korea says there is “no possibility” of unilateral disarmament if it does not have confidence
On Saturday, the Foreign Minister of North Korea informed the United Nations that the continuation of sanctions deepened his distrust of the United States and that there was no possibility of his country renouncing its nuclear weapons unilaterally under these circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho declared before the General Assembly of the international organization that North Korea had adopted “important measures of goodwill” throughout the year, as to stop nuclear tests and missiles, dismantle nuclear test sites and commit to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“However, we have not received any similar response from the United States.”
“If we don’t have confidence in the United States, we can’t have confidence in our national security, and, in those circumstances, there is no possibility of us disarming unilaterally.”
Although Ri repeated the known complaints of North Korea about the United States’ resistance to a “phased” nuclear disarmament formula that rewards the country as it takes steps, his statement is important, as he did not reject a unilateral nuclear disarmament, as North Korea has done in the past.
He made reference to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump after the first summit between an active US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim committed to working toward denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and Trump guaranteed the security of North Korea.
North Korea has pursued the official end of the Korean War, but the United States has said that North Korea must give up its nuclear weapons before it can be considered to have ended the war.
In addition, Washington has resisted calls to soften international sanctions on North Korea.
“The United States has insisted on nuclear disarmament first and has increased pressure through sanctions in order to achieve its goal coercively, even objecting to a termination of the war declaration”, Ri said.
“The idea that sanctions can make us fall on our knees is a chimera of people who don’t know us.
The problem is that the continuation of the sanctions deepens our distrust.
Ri did not mention any plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, announced with a bang and a whimper by the US president at the UN General Assembly a few days ago.
Instead of that, the minister put emphasis on three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae, leader of South Korea, in the last five months, and added: “If South Korea had been the interested party in the denuclearization of the peninsula instead of the United States, the denuclearization of the peninsula would not be in such a stalemate.”
Even so, the tone of Ri’s speech was radically different from last year’s speech, when he said to the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to direct the missiles of North Korea toward US soil after Trump, in a suicidal mission, called Kim “rocket man”.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in moving toward disarmament, but said there was still much to do and that sanctions would have to be maintained until North Korea denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said that there was no deadline for this: “We can take two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward North Korea for its advances.
However, as the US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, informed the Security Council on Thursday: “The imposition of the sanctions of the Security Council must continue energetically and without non-compliance until we realize the complete and verifiable denuclearization.”
The Security Council has imposed sanctions unanimously on North Korea since 2006, in an attempt to cut off funding for its ballistic missile and nuclear programs.
Pompeo chatted with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and then commented that he would return to Pyongyang in a month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not good.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that there had been advances, but a few hours later North Korea denounced that its “demands were those of a gangster”.
In a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea committed to dismantling a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States applied the “appropriate measures.”
He said that Kim had told him that the “measures” that he was looking for were the guarantees of security that Trump had promised in Singapore and steps towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to sleep enough
Thanks to a new course that is being taught this year at Harvard University, all students are now sleeping more in an attempt to fight against the growing culture of studying all night drinking coffee.
A professor discovered that the students of the number one university in the world do not have any idea about the basic care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which is believed to be the first of its kind in the United States.
His motivation to start the course came after giving a talk about how sleep deprivation affects learning.
“At the end of the course, a girl approached and asked me why she just found out about this now, in her last year.”
He said that no one had ever spoken to him about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, taught for the first time this year, explains to students the basic concepts about how good sleep habits contribute to academic and athletic performance, as well as improving overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said that the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students were sleeping only during the week.
The course of one hour includes a series of interactive tasks.
In a section, there is an image of a bedroom, where students click on cups of coffee, curtains, sports shoes and books that inform them about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of lack of sleep on sports performance and the importance of establishing a routine to go to sleep.
In another section, it is explained to the participants how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
After, an icon of the campus with interactive icons animates the participants to think about their daily routines.
“We know that it will not change the behavior of students immediately.”
However, we believe they have a right to know, just as any has a right to know the health effects of smoking tobacco.
He said that the culture of pride in staying up all night still exists and added that modern technology and the pressure students are under mean that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Sleeping enough and a good quality sleep should be “the secret weapon” of students to fight stress, tiredness and anxiety; even to avoid gaining weight, since sleep deprivation makes the brain generate a feeling of hunger, so they want to eat all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying biochemistry and physics, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes during his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to expand it to the whole campus.
Wait until the next step is to ask all graduate students to complete a similar program before joining the competitive institution.
The recommendation of Professor Czeisler is that students think about putting an alarm to go to bed and another to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of the “blue light” emitted by the screens of electronic devices and LED, which can alter circadian rhythms, so that they would have problems falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - Rangers 0: Menga's goal sinks Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another episode of depression away from home, when the attack of Dolly Menga desterred the disarticulated team of Steven Gerrard to a defeat 1-0 in Livingston.
Rangers wanted to get their first win away from home since the 4-1 win at St. Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team beat them for the second time in 18 games as manager, leaving his team eight points behind the Hearts, who are leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
The attack of Menga took place in the 45th minute and the Rangers' uninspired lineup was not up to the task at any point.
Now, Rangers are down to sixth, Livingston are up to third, behind Hibs by the difference in goals.
The Rangers may have more problems, as the linesman Calum Spence had to receive medical assistance after allegedly being hit by an object from the visiting supporters.
Gerrard changed eight of the eleven players who won the game against Ayr, entering the semifinals of the Scottish Cup.
On the other hand, Holt took the 11 players who started the Livingston game that drew with Hearts last week and would have been pleased with the way his organised team stifled the opposition throughout.
The Rangers may have had more possession, but Livingston made better use of the ball when they had it.
They should have scored at the two minutes of the beginning, when Menga made a pass to Scott Pittman who passed between the defense, leaving him alone in front of Allan McGregor, but the midfielder sent it out.
Keaghan Jacobs scored a goal in the deep for captain Craig Halket, but his partner in defense, Alan Lithgow, could only send it out by the long pole.
The Rangers recovered control, but it seemed like there was more hope than conviction about their game in the last third.
There is no doubt that Alfredo Morelos felt that he had been penalized in the 15th minute of the game, when he and Steven Lawless collided, but the referee Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian's request.
Rangers scored two goals in the first half, but former Rangers goalkeeper Liam Kelly barely had to deal with the header of Lassana Coulibaly and the boring shot of Ovie Ejaria.
Although the goal scored in the 34th minute by Livingston was against all odds, nobody can deny that they deserved it for the effort they put in.
Again, the Rangers couldn't handle a deep ball to the flat from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher hit the ball for Scott Robinson, who kept his calm and passed the ball to Menga to score the goal.
In the break, Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, which had an immediate impact, as the volante passed the ball to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly came out of his line to block it.
Even so, Livingston kept the visitors exactly in the type of game he likes, with Lithgow and Halkett clearing the way with long passes.
The Holt boys could have taken more advantage of the final stages, but McGregor kept his composure to deny Jacobs before Lithgow finished a corner kick that didn't go in.
The Rangers' substitute, Glen Middleton, claimed a penalty in the final minutes of the game after a clash with Jacobs, but Thomson looked the other way again.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
Now, a page from the “Sunday Morning” section of the “New York Times”: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago, and COUNTING... was born in Germany the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radiation, an invention that culminated in the device known as the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter, which has been a pillar of science since then, also became a pillar of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "The Singing Hill", with the actors Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in the apparently incompatible roles of scientists cowboys:
Man: “What the hell is that?”
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter, it’s used to locate radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put on the headphones, you can hear the effect of the radioactivity emitted by the minerals.
Evans: “It’s like a radio!”
“Hans” Geiger died in 1945, when he was about to turn 63.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to “see” cancer cells
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to “see” the malignant cells and kill them.
As part of the treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells.
The method requires the extraction of immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory.
So, they can “see” a common protein in many cancers and re-inject it.
A vaccine essay is generating promising results in patients with different cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method requires the extraction of immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory so that they can “see” a common protein called HER2, and, subsequently, reinject them.
Jay Berzofsky, director of the Center for Global Health at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “promotes the growth of different types of cancer”, such as breast, ovary, lung or colorectal cancer, explained the professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach of taking immune cells from patients and “teaching” them to attack cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West boarded the Trump train with a MAGA hat after his appearance on SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was booed off the stage of Saturday Night Live after a chaotic performance in which he praised Donald Trump and said he would run for president in 2020.
After the third song of the night, called Ghost Town, during which he used the hat with the message Make America Great Again, he started to rant against Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“I often speak with someone white and they ask me how I can like Trump since he is racist.”
Well, if I worried about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago.
Saturday Night Live started the show with a sketch of Matt Damon making fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee in relation to the sexual assault allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, comedian Chris Rock posted the recording of the West's tantrum on social networks.
It is not clear if Rock was trying to ridicule West with the publication.
In addition, West said to the audience that he had a bad time on stage because he was wearing that hat.
They got into me.
They told me not to go out with the hat on.
They messed with me!
And then they tell me I’m sleeping”, declared, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: “I’m going to sleep now. I’m going to sleep like a log.” and added that he was “going to put on his cape of superman, because that meant that nobody could tell him what to do. Do you want the world to advance?”
I’m not sure what the Spanish is supposed to mean, but I think it’s supposed to be “¿Queréis que el mundo avance?” (Do you want the world to advance?)
I’m not sure what the English is supposed to mean, but I think it’s supposed to be “Do you want the world to advance?” (Do you want the world to advance?)
I’m not sure what the Spanish is supposed to mean, but I think it’s supposed to be “¿Queréis que el mundo avance?” (Do you want the world to advance?)
I’m not sure what the English is supposed to mean, but I think it’s supposed to be “Do you want the world to advance?” (Do you want the world to advance?)
I’m not sure what the Spanish is supposed to mean,
Try with love.
His comments received boos from the audience at least twice and the members of SNL seemed to be embarrassed, according to Variety. One person told the magazine: “The studio was completely silent.”
West had been invited to replace the singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died recently.
West surprised many when he came out on stage wearing a Perrier bottle.
West received the support of the leader of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: “One of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR RESISTING THE MASSES”.
Karen Hunter, host of a talk show, tweeted that West was “just being himself and that is absolutely wonderful”.
“But I decide NOT to reward someone (buying their music or clothes, or supporting their art) who I consider is embracing and spreading a dangerous ideology for my community.”
He is free.

Before the program, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that now he was “the person previously known as Kanye West”.
It's not the first artist who changes his name, following the steps of Puff Daddy, also known as P Diddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Snoop Dogg has also changed his name to Snoop Lion, without forgetting the legendary musician Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and then to an artist previously known as Prince.
Attempted murder of a man with a knife in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.

It is expected that the accused will appear in the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The Fiscal will review the charges.
Kit Harington, star of Game of Thrones, attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is famous for his role as Jon Snow in the violent fantasy series Game of Thrones on HBO.
The actor, 31, has attacked the stereotype of the male hero, saying that those roles in film often transmitted to young men that they had to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he believes “something went wrong” and questioned how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the era of #MeToo.
Kit Harington, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, 31, also admitted that he thinks it’s “fairly important” to address the issue.
“Personally, I think it’s quite important at this moment, where have we gone wrong with masculinity?”, commented.
“What have we been teaching men while they grew up, thinking about the problems they see now?”
Kit thinks that television can have part of the responsibility for the growing toxic masculinity due to its male characters.
And he continued: “What is innate and what is taught?”
What is taught on television, and in the street, that makes young people feel they have to be this particular kind of man?
I think that is one of the great questions of our time. How do we change it?
Because it is clear that something has gone wrong in the education of the young people.
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not be involved in any prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, saying he is “tired of battlefields and horses”.
From November, Kit will be playing the role of Sam Shepard's True West, the play about a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
A few days ago, the actor revealed that he thinks knowing his wife Rose is the best thing he got out of Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife in the series, so, in that sense, it has given me to my future family and my life from now on.”
Rose was the interest of Ygritte, the character of Kit, Jon Snow, in the fantastic series awarded with Emmy.
The couple got married in June 2018 at a farm belonging to Leslie's family in Scotland.
China reports 14% more new HIV cases
China has announced a 14 % increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
In the country there are more than 820,000 people affected, according to the health authorities.
In the second quarter of 2018, some 40,000 new cases were notified.
The majority of these were infected by sexual contact, which is a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread quickly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contract HIV through this practice has decreased to a great extent, as the Chinese health authorities declared at a conference held in the province of Yunnan.
Every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increases by about 100,000 people.
The transmission of HIV through sexual intercourse is a serious problem in the LGTB community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but the LGTB community suffers a lot of discrimination.
Because of the conservative values of the country, studies have calculated that between 70 % and 90 % of men who have sexual relations with other men will end up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of the diseases are by not using an adequate protection in these relations.
Since 2003, the government of China has promised universal access to HIV/AIDS drugs as part of an effort to confront the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of her staff leaked data on Republican senators and says the allegations are “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
Representative Maxine Waters criticized Saturday the allegations that a member of her staff had published the personal data of three Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of legislators.
The Democratic candidate of Los Angeles said those accusations were pushed by right-wing commentators and websites.
“Lies, lies and more vile lies”, commented Waters in a tweet.
According to the information published, the addresses and phone numbers of the US senators Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah, were included.
On Thursday, an unknown person from the Capitol published the information on the Internet during a session of the Senate Judiciary Committee on the allegations of sexual misconduct made against Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court.
The filtration was done at some point after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, like Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address that identifies the origin of the posts was associated with Waters’ office, and made public the data of a member of Waters’ staff, according to the Capitol.
“This accusation is completely false and a total lie”, continued Waters.
“The member of my personal staff, whose identity, personal data and security have been affected as a result of these fraudulent and false accusations, was not in any way responsible for the leak of this information.”
This allegation without foundation is completely false and an absolute lie.
The declaration of Waters caused immediate criticism on the Internet, including that of the former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“Denies this information with anger”, wrote Fleischer.
This suggests that the necessary temperance for being a Member of Congress is lacking.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they shouldn't get angry.
He must not rebel.
He must not question the motives of the accuser.
He must maintain his calm and serenity.
It seems that Fleischer wanted to compare the reaction of Waters with the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who they accused of seeming too angry during his Thursday testimony.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who hopes to unseat Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
“If it’s true, it’s very grave”, he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said that his office had alerted “the appropriate authorities and the agencies charged with the enforcement of the law” to these fraudulent allegations.
“We will make sure that the authors are discovered,” he continued, “and that they are considered legally responsible for all these destructive and dangerous actions against all members of my staff.”
Johnny English: Again in Action. Rowan Atkinson's parody of the spy falls short
Now it has become a tradition to look for guffs at Brexit in any new film with a British focus. It seems that this is what you should do with this new installment of the parodic action and comedy Johnny English, which started in 2003 with Johnny English and returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English Returns.
Will this ironic self-satire about how clearly ridiculous we are the new opportunity for export of the nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with his bulging eyes and his expressionless face, has renewed his license for the second time. Just his name already gives clues that, more than anything, it is a comedy created for non-English speaking territories.
Of course, it is the ridiculous secret agent, despite his strange pretensions of squandering glamur, has a little of Clouseau, a touch of Mr. Bean and a pinch of that type that touched a single note in the theme of Cars of fire that touched in the inauguration of the Olympic Games of London 2012.
In addition, it was based on the mysterious international traveler and businessman represented years ago by Atkinson in the forgotten television commercials of Barclaycard, sowing chaos behind him.
In this last episode, there are one or two good moments.
I loved seeing Johnny English approaching a helicopter dressed in a medieval armour while the rotors hit the helmet.
The gift of Atkinson for comedy is obvious, but the humor is pretty short and is strangely superfluous, especially now that franchises like James Bond and Mission Impossible add comic ingredients without problems.
The humor seems more directed to children than to adults, and, for me, the absurd adventures of Johnny English are not so ingenious and accurate as the silent jokes of Atkinson in the role of Mr. Bean.
Now, the repeated argument of current affairs is that Britain is in serious difficulties.
A computer pirate has infiltrated the secret network of spies of Great Britain, revealing the identities of all its agents in active service before the consternation of the agent in service, a lamentably small role for Kevin Eldon.
The first minister is a character who is pompous and cornered, and is seeing his popularity sink: Emma Thompson gives the best of herself in this character who is almost like Theresa May, but the script doesn't leave much room for working.
His intelligence advisors inform him that, as all active spies are in danger, he will have to resort to one who is retired.
That must be the clumsy Johnny English, who now teaches at a posh private school, although he teaches extra-curricular classes on how to be a secret agent: there are some good jokes, as it is a spy academy similar to the one in Rock School.
The Prime Minister is meeting with his former friend Bough, now represented by Ben Miller.
Now, Bough is a married man with a submariner captain, a role that he doesn't take advantage of enough with Vicki Pepperdine.
So, the Batman and Robin who do things terribly wrong in the Secret Service of the Queen return to action, with the beautiful woman Ophelia Bulletova, represented by Olga Kurylenko.
While the prime minister is falling into the dangerous claws of a charismatic billionaire from the world of technology who claims he can solve the problems of Britain: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their absurd journey: they disguise themselves as waiters, set fire to a fancy French restaurant, and cause chaos by hiding on a luxurious yacht belonging to Volta; in addition, English becomes pure anarchy when he tries to use a virtual reality helmet to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's house.
Undoubtedly, they used up all their resources in that last sequence, but, however funny and noisy it may be, the whole thing still transmits a somewhat childish sensation.
A fairly regular product.
As with the other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but wonder if the British film industry couldn't give Rowan Atkinson a role that would do justice to his talent.
The Labour Party denies that it is working on a plan to have Britons work four days a week, but get paid for five
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbyn is going to think about a radical plan with which the British would work four days a week, but they would earn five.
Apparently, the party wants the owners of the companies to allocate the savings obtained thanks to the revolution in artificial intelligence (AI) to the workers, giving them an additional day off.
So, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend for the same salary.
According to the sources, the idea “would fit” in the party’s economic agenda and the workers’ plans.
This change to a four-day week has received the support of the Congress of Trade Unions, as it is a way of workers taking advantage of the changing economy.
As a senior Labour Party official told The Sunday Times: We expect the announcement of a review of the directive before the end of the year.
“It will not be possible to achieve it in one day, but the four-day work week is definitely a question that the party hopes to incorporate to rebalance the economy in favor of the worker, as well as in the general industrial strategy of the party.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this type of ideas, as the Green Party already promised a four-day working week in its campaign for the 2017 general elections.
However, for the moment, not all the Labour Party supports this decision.
A Labour spokesman said: "The four-day week is not part of the party's policy and will not be discussed at this time."
The shadow chancellor of the exchequer, John McDonnell, used the Labour Party conference last week to outline his idea of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was willing to restore powers to "anonymous directors" and "abused" directors of public companies that provide public services.
Among the plans of the shadow minister also includes the idea that the current shareholders of the water companies do not recover all their participation, since a Labour government could apply deductions that correspond with the irregularities perceived.
He also confirmed his intention to include workers on the boards of companies and to create inclusive investment funds in which 10 % of the shares of private sector companies would have to be allocated to employees, which would mean annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk about the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh and if it could change their minds
The FBI investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his confirmation as a Supreme Court justice and raised the question of whether the results could sway any Republican senator who decides to withdraw his support.
In an interview that will air on Sunday, 60 Minutes' Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could change their minds.
Kennedy showed himself more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
Of course, said Kennedy.
I was in favor of proceeding with the hearing, I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after all this happened, after the allegation came out and I asked him: 'Did you do it?'
He showed himself firm, resolute, determined.
However, Graham's vote seems inamovible.
I have already made a decision on Brett Kavanaugh and I would ignore the accusation.
Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it tajantely,
And none of the people she names can confirm it.
It has been 36 years.
It's always the same, I don't see anything new in this case.
What is the "Global Citizen Festival"? Has it reduced poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music festival where a star-studded lineup comes together to support a mission just as star-studded: to end poverty in the world.
This year, in its seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will see hundreds of thousands of people travel to Central Park to enjoy performances by Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to be informed about the real objective of the event: ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a group of international awareness that hopes to end poverty through the increase of people who actively fight against it.
If you want to receive a free ticket for the event (unless you can afford a VIP ticket), attendees at the concerts have had to complete a series of tasks or “actions”, such as volunteering, sending emails to a global leader, making a phone call or any other thing that serves to raise awareness about their goal to end poverty.
However, what has the Global Citizen achieved in 12 years?
Is the idea of rewarding with a free concert a genuine way to persuade people to take action or is it just another form of "clicktivism", which is the term we use to describe the position we take when we think we are doing something really useful by signing a petition online or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has claimed to have registered more than 19 million "actions" in favor of a large number of diverse objectives.
Thanks to these actions, they claim to have achieved commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people in 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements that emerged from its actions, of which, already have been disbursed or raised at least 10 billion $.
The group estimates that the guaranteed funds have had a direct impact on almost 649 million people around the world.
Among the most important commitments is "The Power of Nutrition", a UK-based association of investors and implementers united with the common commitment to "help children grow and develop to their full potential". With this aim, they have proposed to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens collaborators.
Thanks to the support of the UK government, the donors, the national governments and the partners of Global Citizens like you, we can mark a small milestone in the history of social injustice of malnutrition.
The group also affirmed that, after having carried out more than 5,000 actions to improve nutrition in the United Kingdom for mothers and children, the government announced the funding of a project, Power of Nutrition, with which 5 million women and children will benefit from nutrition-related interventions.
In response to one of the frequent questions that are asked on your website about what we think can be done to alleviate extreme poverty,
A Global Citizen collaborator responded: "It will be a long and difficult road, and we will stumble and fall.
But, as they have already achieved in the past the movements for human rights and against apartheid, we will achieve our goals, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are some of the performances we will have at the New York event this year, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the Navy to carry out the blockade of Russian energy exports - Department of the Interior
In case of necessity, Washington could resort to its Navy to prevent Russian energy from shaking the markets, including the Middle East, revealed the Secretary of the Interior, Ryan Zinke, according to what is published in the Washington Examiner.
Zinke said that the alliance of Russia with Syria, in particular where it operates on behalf of the legitimate government, is nothing more than a pretext for expansion in new markets.
I am convinced that they are in the Middle East to negotiate with energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, becoming the supplier of the south of Europe.
In addition, according to official information, there are ways and methods to address this issue.
The United States, with its Navy, has the capacity to guarantee that the maritime routes remain open and, in the event, could even block them to guarantee that energy does not end up in the market.
Zinke spoke to the people who attended a meeting organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that describes itself as the "voice of the consumer energy industry in the United States."
In him, compared the approaches that Washington maintains in its negotiations with Russia and Iran, and warned that they are, in fact, the same.
The alternative economic model in Iran and Russia consists, basically, in taking advantage and replacing fuels.
These statements are made when the Trump administration has been trying to promote the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe and to relieve the function of sea to Europe, which is the cheapest option for consumers.
For this, members of the Trump administration, including Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to abandon the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which, according to Trump, will turn Berlin into a hostage of Moscow.
Moscow has insisted on all occasions that the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which has a value of 11 billion dollars and is intended to double the current capacity of the gas pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin defends that the fervent opposition of Washington to the project responds only to economic motives and is another example of unfair competition.
I think we all share the idea that energy cannot be converted into a tool of pressure and that consumers must be able to choose their suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after meeting with Rick Perry, the US Secretary of Energy, in Moscow in September.
The US position has found itself, however, with the rejection of Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The organization that leads the industry in Germany, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has asked the U.S. not to intervene in the energy policy of the EU or in the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
It is a big problem when a third state interferes in our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, director of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a meeting that took place recently between the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the Russian President, Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will carefully examine the possibility of running for president in 2020, says the Massachusetts senator
The senator from Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she will study the possibility of joining the presidential race after the midterm elections.
During a hearing at the Holyoke City Hall, Warren confirmed that she was considering this challenge.
It's time for women to come to Washington to fix our fractured government and to finally have women among our leaders," she said, according to The Hill.
After November 6, I will seriously consider the possibility of running for president.
Warren gave her opinion on President Donald Trump during a press conference at the City Hall and said that "he was taking the country down the wrong path".
I really worry about the damage that Donald Trump is doing to our democracy.
Warren spoke without hesitation about Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet from Friday, Warren said "it is absolutely necessary that the FBI investigate what happened before the vote."
On Thursday, a poll was published in which, however, a majority of Warren's own voters do not believe that she should run for president in 2020.
A 58% of the "possible" voters of Massachusetts said that the senator should not run, according to the survey of the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
32% of the respondents supported his candidacy.
In the survey, the former governor, Deval Patrick, was shown to have a 38 % support and a 48 % opposition.
Other members of the Democratic Party spoke about the possible candidacy for the 2020 presidency of former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
Biden said he would decide in January, according to Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about post-traumatic stress disorder in her son Track Palin at a Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and accused of domestic violence.
The situation that my son is going through, through everything that has happened since he came back, you know very well the other families that suffer the effects of the TEPT and other wounds with which our soldiers return,
Palin referred to this arrest as the great taboo that nobody wants to talk about, and commented on her son and other veterans of war that "they come back with a different attitude, hardened, wondering if there really is that respect for what their fellow soldiers and aviators, as well as all the other members of the army, have given to their country."
On Monday, a man was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, accused of domestic violence, which interferes with a domestic violence complaint and possession of firearms under the influence of drugs or alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. support challenge to get a new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia support a lawsuit against the new US policy that denies asylum to victims of domestic violence or gang violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the District of Columbia presented a "friendly" letter on Friday in Washington to show their support for a refugee applicant who is facing the current directive, according to NBC News.
The name of the plaintiff in the case "Grace v. Sessions" that was filed in August by the ACLU (American Civil Liberties Union) against the federal government's policy is not known.
He said that his companion "and his children, who are members of a violent gang", abused her, but the U.S. officials denied his request for asylum on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The lawyers who represent these states that defend Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum requests to the U.S., as countries that face generalized problems related to domestic violence and gang violence.
The new asylum policy of the United States revoked a decision of 2014 that the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA, for its English acronym) made by which undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence could request asylum in this country.
The Attorney General of the District of Columbia, Karl Racine, made some statements on Friday in which he said that the new policy "ignores decades of international, federal and state law."
According to federal legislation, all asylum requests must be decided on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the individual case and not on the basis of a general rule. This exception to the principle infringes that principle.
In addition, the lawyers wrote in the letter that the policy that denies entry to immigrants hurts the economy of the United States, claiming that they usually become entrepreneurs with more frequency and "are a necessary hand."
The Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to deny asylum to victims of domestic violence and gang violence in June.
People can apply for asylum if they leave their countries because of persecution or threats of persecution based on race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group or political opinion.
The asylum was never created as a measure to alleviate all the problems, not even all the problems that are faced daily by people all over the world.
Desperate efforts to rescue in Palu while the number of dead increases in a race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse and worse.
The situation is very tense", said Risa Kusuma, a mother of 35 years of age, while trying to comfort her baby with fever in a shelter for the displaced in the devastated city of Palu.
Every minute ambulances arrive with more bodies.
And the clean water is scarce.
Some residents have returned to their destroyed homes to search for what little belongings they have left in an effort to recover what they can.
There are hundreds of injured people and the hospitals, also damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake, are overwhelmed.
Some of the wounded; among them, Dwi Haris, who has a broken back and shoulder, rested in the outer area of the Army Hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outside the building due to the continuous aftershocks, also very strong.
I couldn't help but cry when he told us about the violent earthquake he lived through while he was on the 5th floor of the hotel with his wife and daughter.
We didn't have time to get to safety.
I was trapped in the ruins of the wall that collapsed, I think", Haris told AP. He and his family were in the city to celebrate a wedding.
I heard my wife ask for help and then a terrible silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope you are well.
The US ambassador to China accuses China of "bullying" with "propaganda announcements"
One week after a Chinese official newspaper published a four-page advertisement in a U.S. newspaper touting the benefits of trade between the U.S. and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
On Wednesday, President Donald Trump, in a speech in Des Moines, Iowa, referred to the China Daily supplement in the Des Moines Register, the most-read newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of trying to interfere in the November 6 elections in the United States, something that China denies.
The accusation that Trump launched against Beijing over its alleged attempt to influence the US elections marked what US officials told Reuters as a new phase in a growing campaign by Washington to pressure China.
While it is common for foreign governments to publish advertisements to promote their commercial activities, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in a growing trade war that has led to an increase in the tariff levels on both sides.
The compensatory tariffs China applied at the beginning of the trade war were designed to fall on the exporters of states like Iowa, which supported the Republican Party of Trump, according to experts from China and the United States.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, said that Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and business people.
According to Branstad in an opinion article in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, China "is intensifying even more that pressure with advertisements in our free press".
To spread its propaganda, the Chinese government is using the precious American tradition of freedom of expression and press freedom to try to publish an advertisement in the Des Moines Register.
In contrast, in the newsstand on the street where we are in Beijing, there are only a few voices that disagree and no reflection of the real diverse opinions that people in China can have on the worrying trajectory that China's economy is taking, since the media is controlled by the firm pressure of the Communist Party of China.
He added that one of the most relevant newspapers in China refused to publish his article, although he did not specify which newspaper.
Analysts say Republicans are distancing themselves from women before midterm elections with the Kavanaugh debacle
Many of the Republicans of renown who are closing ranks in favor of the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of the various sexual assault allegations, analysts have warned that it could produce a setback, especially among women, in the upcoming elections that are being held halfway through the legislative session.
The emotions that surround this fact have been very intense and many Republicans have expressed that they want to continue with the vote.
“In this type of issues, it is not possible to go back”, said Grant Reeher, a professor of Political Science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, to The Hill in an article that was published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that the last attempt by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to position himself in favor of the FBI investigation would be enough to calm the voters who are upset about this matter.
Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday; they are not going to forget tomorrow, or in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, according to the Washington Post.
On Friday morning, the protesters who gathered outside the Senate were chanting "November is coming!" (November will come soon!) in the moment when the Republicans on the Judiciary Committee decided to move forward with Kavanaugh's nomination, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to Mic.
The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats are way beyond all predictions, said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst.
People say that the repercussion is already very relevant and, in fact, it is.
But it could be even greater, especially among the indecisive voters from the outskirts of the cities and the younger voters, between 18 and 29 years old, who do not usually vote, even though they do not like the president".
Even before Ford's public testimony in which she detailed her allegations of sexual assault against Kavanaugh, analysts said it could produce a backlash if Republicans pressed ahead with the confirmation.
This issue has become a big mess for the Republican Party", said Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, as reported by NBC News.
“It’s not just a question of the vote of the committee or the final vote, it’s also about how they’ve handled this and how they’ve treated her,” said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a Democratic super PAC that helps elect Democrats.
However, Americans seem to be divided; they don't know who to believe after the testimonies of Ford and Kavanaugh, although there are a few more who are on Kavanaugh's side.
In a new YouGov poll, it is indicated that 41 % of the respondents believe definitively or probably the testimony of Ford, while 35 % believe definitively or probably the testimony of Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 % said they thought Kavanaugh had lied during his testimony, while 30 % said the same of Ford.
After the push of Flake, the FBI is investigating now the statements of Ford, at least, the ones of another denunciant, Deborah Ramirez, informed The Guardian.
Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week and indicated that Kavanaugh raped her while she was drunk at age 17.
On the other hand, Ramirez claimed that the candidate to the Supreme Court showed his genitals to him at a party when he was studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is considering starting a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is putting together a new company that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt is the last project of the technology legend. A company that is based on the open source platform of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and who will have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention that hides behind Inrupt is "to dominate the world".
He has to be now, said about the startup.
It is a historical moment.
The application uses the Solid technology to allow users to create their own "personal data storage" or a POD.
Can contain lists, lists of pending tasks, the calendar, the music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available in a browser and at the same time.
Something that is exclusive to online data storage is that the user decides completely who can access what type of information.
The company calls it "personal training through data".
The idea of Inrupt, according to the company's director general, John Bruce, is to incorporate resources, processes and the necessary skills to reach everyone.
For the moment, the company is formed by Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform that IBM bought, some of the developers included in the payroll that were hired to work on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week, developers from all over the world could create their own decentralized apps with the tools that are available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking with "Facebook and Google about whether they are going to introduce or not a radical change where all their business models are completely modified from one day to the other.
We are not going to ask permission.
In a Medium post on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote about Inrupt, which "its mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web created in Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last months, Berners-Lee has had a very influential role in the debate about the neutrality of the Internet.
Even though Berners-Lee is launching Inrupt, he will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
I am incredibly optimistic about this next era of the web
Bernard Vann: the priest who won a Victoria Cross in the First World War
The only priest of the Church of England who won a Victoria Cross during the First World War has been honoured in his home town 100 years after his death.
The Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann obtained this decoration on September 29, 1918 in the attack of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, a French sniper killed him four days later and never knew that he had been awarded the highest military honor in Britain.
On Saturday, his two grandchildren discovered a commemorative stone in a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of them, Michael Vann, said that it was "a symbol of special significance" that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after the battle that earned his grandfather the decoration.
According to the London Gazette, the 29th of September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a dense fog and under the intense fire of machine guns and artillery".
After that, he ran to the line of fire and, with the "greatest bravery", he advanced the line before reaching a cannon with one hand and knocking down three of the detachment.
The lieutenant colonel Vann killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just one month after the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that the actions his grandfather took were "so great that I will never be able to reach his level, but they were very instructive."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also deposited a wreath after the parade, which was attended by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "it was a privilege for him to be able to take part in the parade" and added that "the true value of a genuine hero is shown when he is shown such support".
The MMA fans were awake all night for the Bellator 206, but they only saw Peppa Pig
Imagine that he stays awake all night to see the Bellator 206 so that at the end they don't let him see the main event.
The San José cartel had 13 fights, six of which were on the main card, and in the UK it was going to be broadcast live on Channel 5.
At 6 am, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were getting ready to fight, the viewers in the UK were left stunned when the program suddenly changed to Peppa Pig.
Some people were not surprised after having to stay up until the early morning to see the fight.
A Twitter follower described the change to animated cartoons as "a joke".
There is a government regulation that regulates the content that is broadcast from 6 am and this was not appropriate, so they had to change to children's programming.
""Peppa the pig", yes."
The president of the company Bellator, Scott Coker, said that they are going to modify the program to include the British viewers in the next editions.
When I think about the option of the retransmission, I think it can work.
But it's 6am on Sunday, so we couldn't do it until Sunday at our time, which would be Monday for them.
We are watching how to do it.
Believe me, when the programming changed, there were a lot of messages and not all of them were friendly, in fact.
We tried to fix it, because at first we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't like that, it was a government problem.
I promise you that the next time it won't happen.
We will reduce it to five fights instead of six, which are the ones we usually do. We tried to offer more than usual so that the fans were happy and we passed.
It's a very unfortunate situation.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior about his sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he felt inferior because of his sexuality, but this was what motivated him to become a champion.
At 24 years old, he told us that he didn't realize it until he got to high school that "not everyone was like him".
In the first Desert Island Discs programme on Radio 4, presented by Lauren Laverne, she said that her intention in talking about gay rights was to transmit "hope" to other people.
He also told us that becoming a father made him start to put less importance on winning in the Olympics.
The presenter of this mythical program, Kirsty Young, will be absent for some months due to illness.
In the first program of Laverne, Daley, who showed himself as a marginalized, commented that he felt "inferior" to the rest during his childhood, because "it was not accepted socially that you liked children and girls".
He said: "Today, that feeling of inferiority and being different has been what has really given me the power and strength to succeed."
He wanted to show that he was "something", he said, so he didn't disappoint when he finally discovered his sexuality.
The winner of two bronze medals at the Olympics has become a prominent figure in the LGBT movement and his image has been used in the Commonwealth Games held in Australia this year to demand that more countries decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he told it because he felt lucky to live in freedom, without reprisals, and wanted to transmit that "hope" to other people.
The three-time world champion boxer declared that for him too it was a surprise to fall in love with a man, the American film director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married last year the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older, though he said that the age difference has never been a problem.
When you live so much from such a young age (she was at her first Olympics at 14 years old and her father died of cancer three years later), it's hard to find someone of the same age who has gone through the same highs and lows as you.
The couple had a son in June, whom they called Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said that his "global perspective" had changed.
If they had asked me a year ago, all the answers would have been around 'I have to win a gold medal'
But you know what, there are more important things than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is, without a doubt, Robbie's.
His son is called like his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with a brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept that he was going to die and, in fact, one of the last things he asked was if they had the tickets for the London 2012 Olympics, because he wanted to be in the first row.
I wasn't able to tell him that I couldn't be in the first row.
I had his hand between mine when he stopped breathing and it was only at that precise moment when he stopped breathing that I realized that he was not invincible.
The next year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
In that moment I knew that was what I had dreamed of all my life: to compete in the pool in front of my family in the Olympics, there was nothing better.
This fact was also the one that inspired him to choose his first song, Proud, by Heather Small, which accompanied him in the preparation of the Olympic Games. He still got goosebumps.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, in poor form, was left on the bench on Saturday in the Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to reverse his form if he wants to avoid becoming a sad milestone.
Phil Mickelson, who was playing in the event that takes place every two years to try to get a record for the 12th time, was beaten by the captain Furyk for the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being in the center of the action, as many times he has been for the United States, the five times major champion had to cheer on in some moments and, in others, try to perfect his game on the field and thus be able to correct what he suffers.
Never the most direct of drivers, not even in the peak of his career, the player of 48 years is not in his best shape for the field Le Golf National, where the long rough punishes continuously with errant shots.
And if the field is not enough to discourage Mickelson, Mickelson, in the ninth round of Sunday, faces the brilliant champion of the British Open, Francesco Molinari, who has joined the debutant Tommy Fleetwood to win the four games they have played this week.
If the Americans, who were four points behind at the start of the 12 individual matches, started in an impressive way, Mickelson's match could have been decisive.
Furyk showed confidence in his partner, but he could say little more.
He understood perfectly the role he had today, he gave me a pat on the back and, wrapping his arm around me, said he would be ready tomorrow.
He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is in the Hall of Fame and has contributed a lot to these teams before and this week.
I probably didn't imagine him playing two games.
I thought there would be more, but that's how it came out and that's how we thought it should be.
He wants to be there, like the rest.
On Sunday, Mickelson will surpass the record of Nick Faldo of the most games played in the Ryder Cup.
Could be the last of a career that never had been so clear the levels of his individual brand.
Phil Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and 7 ties, although Furyk said his presence added many more intangible values to the team.
He is fun, sarcastic, ingenious, he likes to make fun of others; it is great to have him on the team.
I think the younger players have enjoyed having him as support, also this week; it was fun.
It brings much more than just a game.
The European captain, Thomas Bjorn, knows that leadership can disappear very soon
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows very well that, although you enter with a substantial advantage in the last days of the Ryder Cup, you can easily turn into an uncomfortable tournament.
The Danish made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where a team captained by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but in the end they only managed to finish with the other teams on a minimum margin, winning 14½-13½.
“Don’t you ever forget that we did a great job in Valderrama, we did a great job in Brookline and we lost, we did a great job in Valderrama and we won, but by a very little margin”, said Bjorn, pictured, after seeing the 2018 generation win 5-3 on Friday and leading it with a 10-6 yesterday at Le Golf National.
The history will teach me and the whole world that that team is not finished.
You have to give it all tomorrow.
Come here and do what you have to do.
This doesn't end until the points are in the marker.
We have a goal to achieve, which is to win this trophy, and that is all we have to think about.
I say it all the time, I focus on our 12 players, but we are very aware of what is on the other side where they are, neither more nor less, that the best players in the world".
Proud of what his players have done on a very difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I don't want to go ahead.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
What prevails tomorrow are individual performances and this is different.
It's great to share what's happening when things are going well, but when you're alone, you put your golfing skills to the test.
That's the message we have to transmit to the players, to get the best out of ourselves tomorrow.
Now it's time to leave your partner, go and get the best out of yourself.
In front of Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will try to make his players do better individually than they did as pairs, being the exceptions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who added four points.
Furyk has been in both ends in the last days of those great tournaments and has been part of the team that won in Brookline and then lost when Europe won at Medinah.
I remember every word," he said when we asked him how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, motivated his players on the last day.
We have 12 superimportants tomorrow, but we have to start as well as we did in Brookline, as you saw at Medinah.
When we all advance in the same direction, all the pressure falls on those intermediate parties.
We defined our strategy and they felt like we were going to try to do something magical tomorrow.
Thomas was assigned the task of leading the fight and facing Rory McIlroy in the main match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the second half of the list.
I went with this group of boys in this order because I think they cover the whole route.
The new German battleship, postponed again
The new German Navy frigate should have been commissioned in 2014 to replace the old frigates of the Cold War era, but it will not be commissioned until at least next year due to defective systems and the progressive increase in costs, local media reported.
The delivery of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the ship that leads the new class Baden-Württemberg frigates, has been postponed now until the first half of 2019, according to a statement by a military spokesman cited by the German newspaper Die Zeit.
The ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but the problems that arose after the delivery delayed the completion of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg class frigates that the Navy requested in 2007 will replace the old Bremen class frigates.
We know that they will include a powerful cannon, a set of anti-aircraft missiles and anti-missiles, as well as some technologies of invisibility, such as radar, infrared and acoustic signals very reduced.
Among other important characteristics, the maintenance periods are longer, so that they can be deployed up to two years away from the origin ports.
However, the delays have caused that the innovative ships (that were supposed to allow Germany to project its power in the oceans) will be already outdated when they start to serve, says Die Zeit.
The unfortunate frigate F125 occupied the headlines last year, when the German Navy officially rejected putting the ship into service and returned it to Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy has returned a ship to a shipyard after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind the return, but German media cited a number of "software and hardware defects" that left the ship practically useless if sent on a combat mission.
The software deficiencies were particularly important, since the Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates will be operated by a crew of about 120 seamen: half the crew that was on the old frigates of the class Bremen.
In addition, it was also noted that the ship has an excessive weight, which reduces its performance and limits the capacity of the Navy to add future updates.
It is believed that the "Rheinland-Pfalz" of 7000 tons is twice as heavy as other similar ships used by the Germans in the II World War.
In addition to the defective hardware, the price of the entire project, including the training of the crew, has also been a problem.
It is believed that it has reached the 3100 million € (3600 million $), instead of the initial 2200 million €.
The problems that are attributed to the new frigates are of special relevance in light of the recent warnings about the reduction of the naval power of Germany.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defense committee of the German parliament, admitted that the German Navy is "losing ships capable of deploying".
The official said that the problem has been getting worse with time, because the old ships were decommissioned, but they haven't been replaced with new ones.
He lamented that none of the Baden-Württemberg class frigates could join the Navy.
The National Trust spies on the secret life of bats
This new research, which has been carried out in a Highland area of Scotland, is trying to discover how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
It is expected that all that is discovered will shed more light on the behaviour of the only flying mammals and help to guide future conservation activities.
The study, carried out by the National Trust for Scotland, will follow common and soprano pipistrelles, as well as the Daubenton's bat and the brown long-eared bat in the gardens of Inverewe in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in strategic locations of the property to record the activities of the bats during the season.
The template and the volunteers of NHS will also carry out mobile investigations with portable detectors.
The experts will analyze the sounds that are recorded in the recordings to discover the frequency of the calls of the bats and what species make them.
Then a report and a map of the habitat will be produced to create a detailed image of the environment and its behavior.
Rob Dewar, conservation advisor for nature for NTS, is hoping that the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important for bats and how each species uses them.
With this information, we will be able to determine the benefits of the management of the habitat, such as the creation of meadows and how to maintain the forests for bats and other associated species.
The populations of bats in Scotland and in the United Kingdom have decreased considerably in the last century.
They are under threat from the construction and development that affects their nests and the loss of their habitat.
The wind turbines and the electrical cable can also be a risk for them, as well as the insecticides and other chemical treatments of the construction materials or the attacks of the domestic cats.
The bats are not really blind,
s/he is not as good at hunting as he/she is at hearing, because of his/her nocturnal habits.
They use a sophisticated technique of ecolocation that locates ants and obstacles on their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the whole country, takes the matter of bats very seriously.
It has ten experts trained in the matter, who carry out regular surveys, inspections of nests and, in some cases, rescues.
The organization has inaugurated even the first and only reserve dedicated to bats in Scotland in the state of Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, which is the home of eight of the ten species of bat in Scotland.
The director of the property, David Thompson, says that it is the ideal territory for them.
Here, in Threave, we have a fantastic area for bats.
We have old buildings, many veteran trees and the right habitat.
However, there are still many unknown things about bats, so the work we do here and at other properties will help us to understand better what they need to develop".
It is important to check if there are bats before carrying out maintenance work inside the properties, as it is possible to destroy a bat colony unintentionally and it could kill up to 400 females and their young, which would mean wiping out an entire local population.
The bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or destroy their colonies.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish official of the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to help.
He said: "We still have much to learn about bats and many other species about which we do not know how they evolve their populations".
Ronaldo denies the rape allegations at the same time that his lawyers pursue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has cataloged the rape allegations as "fake news", and says that people "want to get known" at his expense.
The lawyers have been instructed to file a lawsuit against the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the statements.
The forward of Portugal and Juventus is accused of raping a woman from the United States, called Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is accused of having paid 375 000 $ to hide the incident, according to Der Spiegel.
With a video of Instagram Live that has already accumulated 142 million followers hours after the news was published, Ronaldo, 33 years old, tarnished the report as "fake news".
No, no, no, no, no.
What they have said today is false", says the five times winner of the Golden Ball looking at the camera.
They only want publicity at my expense.
It's the same story as always.
They want to make themselves famous by just mentioning me, but it's like that, I can't avoid it.
I am a happy man and everything is fine", added the player, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against Der Spiegel for the accusations that appear in what they call "an unacceptable report on suspicions of privacy", according to Reuters.
The lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player will try to obtain compensation for "moral damages for an amount that corresponds to the gravity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of his personal rights in recent years."
According to what seems to be, the supposed incident took place in June 2009 in a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a night club, supposedly, Ronaldo and Mayorga were in his room and there he, allegedly, raped her anally, according to the documents registered in the District Court of Clark County in Nevada.
Mayorga declared that Ronaldo knelt down after the supposed incident and told him that he was a "good boy" and that he had only disappointed him that "one percent".
In the documents it is declared that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also says that she went to the police and that they took pictures of the wounds in the hospital, but later agreed to a settlement outside of court because she was afraid of "retaliation" and worried about being "humiliated in public".
The woman, 34 years old, says she is trying to annul the agreement, since she is still traumatized by the facts.
When the alleged assault took place, Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United and this summer he has changed to Juventus, a great club of Italian football, for a contract of 100 million €.
Brexit: the United Kingdom would regret forever losing car manufacturers
The United Kingdom "would regret it for the rest of its life" if it lost its position as the world's leading car manufacturer after Brexit, said the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, Greg Clark.
He added that it was "worrying" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that, if Britain left the EU without a deal, production would be temporarily halted at its Burnaston factory near Derby.
We need an agreement, said the Mr. Clark.
The Japanese manufacturer said that the impact that the delays in the customs in the case of a Brexit without agreement could cause the loss of jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which makes Toyota Auris and Avensis models, produced 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
My opinion is that, if Britain breaks with the EU at the end of March, there will be production problems in our factory.
Other car manufacturers from the UK have shown their fears in relation to the exit of the EU without an agreement, especially in relation to the free trade; among them, Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of the car manufacturers are related to the problems that could arise in the assembly lines in the case of a Brexit without an agreement.
Toyota's production line is based on the "just in time" method, where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the EU to make cars by order.
If the UK leaves the EU on March 29 without a deal, it could cause a disruption at the border, according to the sector, which could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
For Toyota, it would be impossible to house the amount of material equivalent to more than a day's inventory in its Derbyshire plant, said the company and, in such a case, production would stop.
Theresa May said that the Chequers plan, where the UK's future relations with the EU are set out, is "calibrated precisely to avoid those controls at the border".
We need an agreement. We want the best agreement that will allow us to come out of this situation well and we have to take advantage of the opportunity.
“The evidence of Toyota, among others, is that we have to be able to continue with what, until now, has been a very successful supply chain.”
Toyota has not been able to say for how long it will stop production, but warned of the long-term costs that would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and, in the end, the costs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at the plant for 24 years and is the Unite union representative at the plant, said his members are increasingly worried: "According to my experience, once those jobs are lost, they never come back."
A government spokesman said: "We have put in place a precise and convincing plan to define our future relations with the EU".
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, according to the White House
The high-risk meeting of Donald Trump with the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein could be postponed another week, as the dispute over the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh continues, said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein supervises the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the elections, links between Trump and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The expectation that Trump will fire the deputy attorney general or not and, in this way, compromise the independence of Mueller has fueled the gossip in Washington for months.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein recorded his conversations with Trump with a microphone that he himself carried to try to remove the president via the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied that it was true.
However, on Monday, he went to the White House, between news where it is said that he was about to resign.
In his place, it was announced a meeting with Trump (who was at that moment in the United Nations in New York) for Thursday.
Trump said he "would prefer not" to fire Rosenstein but the meeting was postponed to avoid a conflict with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday Trump asked the FBI to investigate the allegations against Kavanaugh for a week, although this would delay the vote of the full Senate.
The press secretary of Trump, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "No date has been set, it could be this week or it could be postponed until everything with the Supreme Court is sorted out."
We will decide on the matter as we go along and I will inform the press as I usually do.
Some journalists would refute that statement: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since September 10.
The presenter Chris Wallace asked what were the reasons.
Sanders said that the shortage of press credentials was not due to a dislike of grandiloquent TV reporters, although he said: "I will not disagree with the fact that they fanfaronade."
Next, she suggested that the direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
The president holds more press conferences than any other president before him, said, citing without proof: "We have compared those numbers."
The press briefings will continue, said Sanders, but "if the press has the option to ask directly to the president of the United States, I think it's much better than asking me.
We have tried to do it many times and you have seen us do it many times in the last weeks, so this would replace a press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump usually responds to questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in public sessions or press conferences with dignitaries who visit him.
The press conferences with him alone occur very rarely.
In fact, this week, in New York, the president demonstrated why, where he made an unpretentious and, at times, bizarre appearance before the assembled press.
The Scottish Government writes to NHS staff in Scotland about their fears over Brexit
The Secretary of State for Health has written to the staff of the EU office working in the HHS of Scotland to express their gratitude and their wish to continue working with them after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter just six months before the UK leaves the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed to cover the cost of citizenship applications for EU citizens working in public services that are not dependent on the central government.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union continued on the exit, which was expected to take place this autumn.
However, the government of the United Kingdom has also intensified its preparations in relation to a possible scenario in which there would be no agreement.
I know this must be very confusing for you.
Yes, that is why I would like to reiterate now how much I value the contribution of each and every one of the members of the staff, regardless of their nationality.
Professionals from all over Europe and other countries bring valuable experience and many skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, which benefits patients and communities.
Scotland is, without a doubt, your home and we would love to continue counting on you.
A Christian Abercrombie is being operated on urgently after suffering a head injury
Christion Abercrombie, a player of the Tennessee State Tigers was operated on emergency surgery after suffering a head injury the past Saturday, when they lost 31-27 against Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ of the Tennesse.
The Tennessee State coach, Rod Reed, told the press that the injury occurred just before the break.
He went to the band and collapsed there.
The coaches and the medical staff administered oxygen to Abercrombie on the sideline before placing him on a stretcher and taking him for a full examination.
A member of the Tennessee State team told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details about the type of injury yet or the damage caused" and the Tennessee State is trying to find out when it happened.
Abercrombie, redshirt sophomore, is playing in his first season with Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He made five tackles on Saturday before leaving the field, with which he added a total of 18 for the whole season.

The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year which will be spent on the homeless
The additional money raised by the increase in the stamp duty on foreign buyers of property in the UK will be used to help the homeless, announced Theresa May today.
The measure is understood as an attempt to neutralize the success that Jeremy Corbyn is having with his promises to provide more affordable housing for young people and to harass those with higher incomes.
The increase in the transmission of land tax will be levied on people and companies that do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom and that money will be used to incentivize the government's policy to combat begging on the streets.
The surcharge, which is a supplement to the current transfer tax, also includes the increase in levels that was introduced two years ago on second-hand homes and the "buy-to-let" system, which could reach up to 3 %
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year with this change.
It is estimated that 13% of new build properties in London are bought by people who do not live in the UK, which is causing the increase in prices and making it difficult for first time buyers to access an affordable home.
Many of the country's most affluent areas (especially in the capital) have become "ghost cities" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the stamp duty on homes to help young people buy their first home.
He accused the big builders of keeping the prices of the properties very high by buying land without any intention of using it and asked the Sra. May to eliminate the fees that are applied to affordable homes to solve the "shameful problem of housing" in Great Britain.
Mr. Corbyn has announced a series of very attractive reforms for housing, among which are controls on rent and the end of evictions without reason.
He also proposes to give local authorities more powers to build new homes.
The Prime Minister said: "Last year I said that I would dedicate my time as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream of improving the lives of every new generation."
And that implies solving the housing market, which is so devastated.
Great Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be that people who do not live in the UK, as well as foreign companies, can buy homes with greater ease than the working class.
The dream of having a house has become too difficult to achieve for many people and the humiliation of having to sleep on the street is still too real.
Jack Ross: "My primary objective is to lead Scotland"
The Sunderland manager says his "primary objective" is to become the manager of Scotland at some point.
The Scottish, 42 years old, is excited about the possibility of revitalizing the club of the north-east, which at the moment occupies the third place in the League One (the third division of English football), three points from the first.
Passed to Stadium of Light this summer after leading St. Mirren again to the Premier Scottish league last season.
I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
But I only got a hat B", he said in Sportsound on BBC Scotland.
But I grew up seeing Scotland in Hampden with my father when I was a child and it's something that always makes me want to go back.
That opportunity will only become reality, however, if I manage to lead a club to success.
Among the predecessors of Ross as manager of Sunderland are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paolo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic manager says he did not feel any fear when he turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town, after rejecting proposals from the two Championship clubs.
In this moment, my success is measured by whether I can get this club back into the Premier League.
because the structure and the installations of this club correspond, without a doubt, to the Premier League", said.
It's not easy to get it, but I could only consider that I have achieved my goal here when I can return the club to where it should be.
Ross is the only coach who has been in charge for three years, after being an assistant coach at Dumbarton and a period of 15 months at the Hearts technical staff.
After that, he helped the Alloa to recover from the relegation to the third division and made the St. Mirren to win the championship in the following season.
In fact, Ross says he feels more comfortable now than ever before during his career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It was probably a real crossroads,” he recalled when he took over at Alloa.
I always thought that the direction was what I did best, much more than playing.
It can sound weird, because it was good, I could make a living with it and I enjoyed some epic moments.
But playing can be very hard.
You have to face many things every week.
I still suffer the stress and pressure of that job; however, in the direction I feel good.
I always wanted to train and now I have achieved it, it is the time of my adult life when I have felt better, without a doubt.

According to a survey, the perfect time for a pint is 5.30pm on a Saturday
The heatwave of the summer has pushed up the profits of British pubs that are struggling to survive, but concentrated all the pressure on the restaurant chains.
The groups of pubs and bars saw their sales increase by 2.7 % in July, while the restaurant sector saw their profits fall by 4.8 %, according to the figures.
Peter Martin, from the consultancy CGA, who compiled the figures, commented: "The heat of these days and the fact that England is still in the World Cup have made that in July the pattern of the previous month of June, in which pubs increased 2.8% their profits, while restaurants have even fallen a little more.
The 1.8 % fall in the activity of restaurants in June was even worse in July.
The pubs and bars that mainly serve drinks had their best month, compared to the majority of restaurants, where they reduced their profits.
The pubs that serve mainly meals also suffered with the heat, although not as drastically as restaurant operators.
It seems that people only want to go out to drink.
In bars and pubs managed, sales of drinks rose 6.6 % during the month, while sales of meals fell 3 %.
Paul Newman, the analyst of hospitality and leisure of RSM said: "These results follow the trend that we have seen since the end of April.
The time and the repercussion of social or sporting events very important are still the most relevant factors in what concerns to the sales of activities outside the home.
It is not surprising that the restaurant groups are still fighting, although the 4.8% drop in sales compared to last year will be especially painful given the continuing pressures on costs.
The long and hot summer could not have come at a worse time for the restaurant operators and the weather will tell us if the more moderate temperatures that we have had in August will provide the relief that they need.
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including the new ones that have opened, was 2.7% in July, which reflects the slow decline in the number of brand openings.
In Coffer Peach Tracker, which oversees sales in the UK restaurant, bar and pub sector, data is collected and analysed for 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of more than £9bn.
One in five children have secret accounts on social networks, away from their parents
One in five children (some even as young as 11) have secret accounts on social media sites, despite the fact that their parents and teachers know about them, according to a survey
The survey, conducted with 20,000 high school students, revealed a growth in the number of fake Instagram pages
The news have sharpened fears that the content will be published
20% of the students said they have a "main" account that shows their parents
One out of every five children (some even as young as 11 years old) create secret accounts on social media that hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed the rapid growth that has been experienced in fake Instagram accounts, a site for sharing photos.
The news have sharpened fears that the content will be published.
20% of the students said they had a "main" account that showed their parents, while at the same time they had other private accounts.
A mother who accidentally found her 13-year-old daughter's secret site saw how a teenager encouraged others to "violate" her.
The research, carried out by the Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40% of children aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, and half admitted to having private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, director of HMC, said: "It is alarming that so many teenagers feel tempted to create spaces on the Internet where their parents and teachers cannot find them".
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" in the board of the Scottish Athletics Federation
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to form part of the executive board of the Scottish Athletics Federation as non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated athlete in Scotland on track and field and her president, Ian Beattie, described the change as a great opportunity for those who want to see sport benefit from her great experience over the past decade.
Eilidh is recognised and respected throughout the athletics community in Scotland, the United Kingdom and the world, and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will benefit enormously from her involvement in the sport.
Doyle said: "I like to be the voice of the athletes and I hope to be able to contribute things and help to develop sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200 meters and the 400 meters in the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and now is a regular expert in the BBC, suffered a transient ischemic attack that left him without the ability to walk.
He wrote on Twitter: "One month ago, I suffered a cerebrovascular accident."
I couldn't walk.
According to the doctors, only time would tell if I would recover or how much I would recover.
It was exhausting, but I recovered completely, I had to learn to walk again and I'm now doing agility exercises.
Thank you for the messages and words of encouragement!"
The ad for the breast pump where they compare mothers to cows divides opinion on the Internet
A company of breast pumps has divided the opinion in the Internet with an advertisement where it compares mothers who breastfeed with cows that are milked.
To mark the launch of what in theory is the "silent first breast pump in the world", the consumer technology company Elvie published an ad inspired by a video with somewhat ironic music where mothers tell about the freedom that the new breast pump gives them.
Four real women dance in a barn full of hay, in the style of a dance floor, with letters like: "Yes, I milk myself, but I don't have a tail" and "Just in case you haven't noticed, they're not udders, they're my breasts".
The choir continues to say: "Order them, order them, I am feeding their babies, order them, order them, I am feeding my women".
However, the announcement, which was published on the Facebook page of the company, has created a great controversy.
With 77 000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received reactions from all kinds of people who have seen it, where many say that it manages to put the focus on the horrors of the dairy sector.
A very unfortunate decision to put cows to advertise this product.
As we do, they have to get pregnant before giving birth to be able to produce milk, with the exception that they take their babies away from them days after giving birth.
The Elvie breast pump fits discreetly in a nursing bra (Elvie/Mother).
Another person commented: "Traumatic for the mother and the baby."
But, yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who stay with their babies?"
Another comment was: “What a crazy ad”.
However, other people defended the ad, like a woman who admitted that the song was “destructive”.
I think it’s a great idea.
If I were still breastfeeding, I'd have one.
When I used the pump, I felt like a cow.
The ad is a bit crazy, but I don't give it any more thought.
It’s a great product”, she said.
Another person commented: “It’s a funny ad directed at mothers who use a breast pump (sometimes at work or in public restrooms), which makes them feel like cows.”
In the ad, no one praises or judges the dairy sector.
At the end of the video, the group of women show that they have been dancing with the discreet bombs placed inside the brassieres.
The concept of the campaign is based on the perception that many women who express milk with a pump say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely silent, it has no cables or tubes, and it is discreetly attached to the nursing bra, which makes it possible for its users to move, hold their babies and even go out with the pump in operation.
Ana Balarin, social and ECD of Mother, tells us: “The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
Showing the parallel between expressive women and cows, we wanted to call attention to the use of the milking machines and their challenges, as well as to demonstrate the incredible sensation of freedom that the new milking machine offers.
This is not the first time Elvie appears in the headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two children walked the runway for the designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of unaccompanied minors secretly sent to a camp on the Texas border
The number of minors detained has increased considerably, despite the fact that the monthly influx at the border has remained at the usual levels. In part, this is due to the harsh rhetoric and the policies introduced by the Trump administration, which are complicating the possibility of sponsoring these children.
Traditionally, most of the godparents, who were also undocumented immigrants at the time, feared that proposing to host a child would put their own stay in the country in jeopardy.
This risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their families would have to submit their fingerprints and that the data would be shared with government immigration agencies.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a high-ranking official at the Department of Homeland Security, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who sought to sponsor children who were not accompanied by a parent.
The agency confirmed later that 70% of the arrested had no criminal records.
“Around 80% of the sponsors or their relatives are in the country illegally, and a large part of them are criminal immigrants.”
Therefore, we are still pursuing these people”, said Albence.
In his effort to process minors more quickly, the officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear before the court within a maximum of one month from the arrest, instead of 60 days, which was the previous norm, according to the workers of the centers of reception.
Many of them will testify by videoconference, instead of in person, to defend their legal status before a judge for immigration issues.
Those who do not consider themselves eligible for asylum will be deported as soon as possible.
According to the workers at the centers and the reports from the system that have emerged in the last months, the longer they are held in custody, the greater the probability that they will suffer anxiety or depression, which could lead to violent outbursts or attempts to escape.
As commented by the defenders, these concerns increase even more in larger facilities, such as Tornillo, where it is more likely that, due to its size, they will be overlooked by the signs of distress in these children.
In addition, the transfer to the camp without having given them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to their friends could provoke them a trauma that many are already suffering.
Syria asks the “occupation forces” of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
In a speech before the UN General Assembly, the Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that the war in the country has been going on for eight years.
Moualem, who is also the vice-prime minister, said that foreign forces were illegally in Syrian territory under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that the issue “will be dealt with accordingly”.
“They must withdraw immediately and without conditions,” he said to the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the “war against terrorism practically has ended” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have been displaced from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue “fighting this sacred battle until we purify all Syrian territories of terrorists and any foreign presence.”
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, mainly providing training and advising to the Kurdish and Arab forces in Syria that are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in this devastated country by war.
On the refugee topic, Moualem said that the conditions were right for them to return and blamed “some Western countries” for “seeding irrational fears” that made them decide to stay outside the country.
“We have requested the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,”
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have already warned that they will not help with the reconstruction of Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The diplomats of the UN say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a containment zone in the last rebel bastion of Idlib has created an opportunity to force political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey averted a large-scale assault on the Syrian forces and Russian forces in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem has made clear that the agreement had clear deadlines and has expressed the hope that the military action will focus on the jihadists, including the Nusra Front (linked to Al-Qaeda), which will be eradicated.
Staffan de Mistura, the UN special envoy, is waiting to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to draft a new constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem established the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, arguing that the work of the panel should be limited “to review the articles of the current constitution” and warned against any interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to that logic, Trump would win reelection in 2020, unless, as many liberal viewers are probably expecting, a resignation or scandal prematurely ends his presidency.
This would be without a doubt “The most dramatic end of a presidency ever seen!”
At the moment there are no signs of fatigue in the spectators.
Since 2014, the ratings achieved in the prime time audience have doubled to 1.05 million for CNN and have almost tripled to 1.6 million for MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in the prime-time audience, compared with 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and “The Rachel Maddow Show” on MSNBC has surpassed the ratings of cable news channels with 3.5 million viewers for the main news programs at night.
“It’s a strange attraction that we still can’t understand”, Neal Baer, the show’s executive producer, tells us. “Designated Survivor” is a drama series about a secretary of the cabinet who becomes president after a terrorist attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club”, has another theory.
Remember a taxi ride he took in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The taxi driver told him that he would vote for Trump.
Why?
“Because it makes me laugh”, was the answer Scovell received.
Chaos is always at the top in the world of entertainment.
Obviously, and unlike everything else that is seen on television, the arguments that come out of Washington could determine the future of the Roe v. Wade case, the possibility of families of immigrants being able to reunite, or the health of the global economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the privileged can afford.
However, the information about the panel of experts debating the use of “deep background” sources that Bob Woodward used for his book “Fear”, the hunter’s coat of $15,000 from Paul Manafort (“a garment of excessive pride”, in the words of The Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy Daniels’s scabrous descriptions of Trump’s anatomy, is overwhelming when you consider that you have been watching a panel of experts debating the use of “deep background” sources for six hours.
In my opinion, I will never see Super Mario the same way again.
“By offering something new every night, it’s in part what makes everything seem like a reality show,” says Brent Montgomery, executive producer of “Pawn Stars” and creator of “Pawn Stars,” when we talk about the rotating cast of Trump and his daily drama (whether it’s fighting the NFL or praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss an episode if you don't want to get left behind.
When I went to talk to the Sr. Fleiss this week, it was a sunny 27 degrees on the north coast of Kauai, but he was inside the house watching MSNBC and CNN at the same time.
He couldn't tear himself away from the television, not with Brett Kavanaugh ready to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging in the balance.
“I remember when in those days we did all those crazy things with programs and people told us that that was the beginning of the end of western civilization”, Fleiss tells me.
“I thought it was all a joke, but in the end they were right.”

The foreign money flows into the midterm elections of the most adjusted House of Representatives
It is not a surprise that the influx of money is coming to the 17th district of Pennsylvania, thanks to the reorganization of a district of the Congress with two candidates who seek reelection to the same seat.
This residential district of Pittsburg, which was recently redesigned, has the Democratic representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election in the spring.
Lamb faces another Republican challenger, Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th District of Pennsylvania, a district that overlaps with the new 17th District.
The maps were redrawn after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the old districts had been manipulated unconstitutionally in favor of Republicans.
The race for the new 17 has triggered a financing battle between the main financial arms of the parties, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC).
The name of Lamb became very familiar in Pennsylvania after a close victory in a special election in March for the 18th Congressional District.
That seat had been occupied by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
The political experts have given the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States considered penalizing El Salvador for its support of China, but later backed down
Diplomats observed that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with a slight rejection by Washington.
Trump had a friendly meeting with the President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and occupied a hotel in Panama until the partners of the Trump Organization were evicted.
The State Department officials decided to recall the chiefs of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to the “recent decisions to stop recognizing Taiwan”, said Heather Nauert, the department’s spokeswoman, in a statement this month.
But only El Salvador was sanctioned, which had already received around $140 million in US aid in 2017 for, among other things, the control of drug trafficking, the development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts to financial aid and restrictions on certain visas, would have been very painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and crime rates.
As the internal meetings advanced, the U.S. and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and prosperity as a follow-up to a similar meeting held last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent emigration to the United States.
But at the end of September, high-ranking officials in the administration made clear that their intention was that the conference go ahead, which put an end to any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is expected to speak at the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October and which, according to diplomats, is seen as a signal of the importance that the administration has given to the meeting.
The three US envoys returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new threats or punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesman rejected to comment on the details of the debate described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal deliberations under the condition of anonymity.
His explanations were corroborated by an external analyst close to the administration, who also spoke under condition of anonymity.
The study of history
The next step could be the report of the special counsel Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of justice by Trump, of which there are already considerable public evidence.
It is also believed that Mueller is also investigating the possibility that the Trump campaign worked in parallel with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If the Congress changes hands, Trump will be held accountable before that chamber, just as he is preparing to run for office again, and perhaps finally before a jury of his peers.
This is a lot of conditional sentences, and with this I do not suggest that the fall of Trump is inevitable, nor the fall of his equivalent in Europe.
We will all have to take decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will have an effect on the duration of the conflict.
In 1938, the German officers were ready to stage a coup against Hitler. All that was needed was for the West to have resisted and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The history of the world revolves around these points of inflexion, and the inexorable march of democracy accelerates or slows down.
The Americans are now facing several of these points of inflexion.
What will we do if Trump fires the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of the Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a good position since this newspaper reported last year that he had suggested secretly recording the president and had speculated about his inability to serve in the office.
Rosenstein says that the explanation of The Times is not exact.
“How will we respond if the new investigation that the FBI has requested about Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?”
In addition to all this, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail these exams, we will find ourselves in a long winter for democracy.
But, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague, I think we won't fail.
My mother was a Czech Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same regime that had once occupied my embassy.
He survived, emigrated to the United States and, 60 years later, sent me to light the Sabbath candles on the same table decorated with a swastika.
With that inheritance, how can I not be optimistic about our future?”

Graham Dorrans of Rangers, optimistic about the match against Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will play at home against Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a victory over the Austrians, after the impressive draw against Villarreal at the beginning of the month, will put them in a strong position to qualify for the Europa League group stage.
A knee injury prevented Rangers midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season until the 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use that result as a springboard for bigger things.
“We got a good point, because Villarreal is a good team”, said the 31-year-old player.
“We started the game believing we could get something and we came away with a point.
Perhaps we could have won the match at the end, but, in general, the draw was perhaps a fair result.
They were better in the first half, but after the break we came out fighting and were the better team.
This Thursday we will have another great night in Europe.
I hope we can get the three points, but it will be a difficult game because they got a good result in the previous game. But, with all the support from the fans, I am sure we can get a positive result.
Last year was definitely hard with my injuries and the changes in the club, but now you can feel a general atmosphere that everything will be fine.
The team is well, the boys are enjoying themselves a lot and we are having a good training session.
I hope we can move forward, leave behind last season and achieve success.
The fear of retirement savings is making some women lose sleep
Although the participants of the survey had a clear idea of how they wanted to be treated, few people talk about this with their families.
Around half of the people who took part in the Nationwide study said they talked to their partners about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about this topic.
“People want me to take care of them, but they’re not taking the steps to have this conversation,” says Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
This is the way to begin.
Talk to your spouse and your children: you can't prepare your family to care for you if you don't express your wishes in advance.
Work with your advisor and your family to talk about where and how to receive care, as these options can be a determining factor in the cost.
Include in the conversion to your financial advisor, since it can also help you find a way to pay for those expenses.
Your options for financing long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value to help cover your expenses or to insure yourself with your own savings, as long as you have the money.
Negotiate your legal documents: get ahead of the legal battles.
Take responsibility for obtaining a power of attorney for medical care to designate a person to supervise your medical care and to ensure that professionals comply with your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
He can also prepare a power of attorney for his finances.
Select a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that your bills are paid if you become incapacitated.
Don't forget the small details: imagine that your elderly father has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Could you answer the questions about medicines and allergies?
Describe all these details in a written plan so that it is always ready.
“It’s not just the finances that are at stake: what doctors do you have to treat?” asks Martin.
“What medications is he taking?”
Who will take care of the dog?
You have to have everything planned.
Several times a man is shot with a rifle in Ilfracombe
They have shot a man several times with a rifle as he was walking home after leaving the house at night.
The victim, a man in his 40s, was found in the area of Oxford Grove in Ilfracombe (Devon) when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
The police officers described the shooting, which happened around 02:30 (British time), as a “random act”.
The victim did not see her attacker.
His injuries are not fatal and the police have made an appeal for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, said officials. It is expected that the death toll will increase.
With communications blocked, the officials of the disaster assistance have not been able to get any information from the regency of Donggala, a northern area of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here you can see some important details about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, which is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a regency that stretches along more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The Regency, which is a hierarchical administrative region inferior to the province, had a population of 299,200 people in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of the province of Central Sulawesi, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
The nickel mines also have their importance in the province, but concentrate mainly in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been affected by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit the west of Donggala in 1996, with nine victims.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire, a zone of great seismic activity, and it often suffers earthquakes.
Following, we summarize some of the main earthquakes and tsunamis of the last years:
2004: A great earthquake in the western coast of the province of Aceh of Indonesia, in the north of Sumatra, caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries and took the life of 226.000 people in the coast of the Indian Ocean. More than half of the victims occurred in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes struck the western coast of Sumatra at the end of March and the beginning of April.
There were hundreds of dead victims on the island of Nias, facing the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck the southern tip of Java, the most populated island of Indonesia, and triggered a tsunami that affected the southern coast, with almost 700 deaths.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands, near Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed some 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the regency of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, recalling the devastation of the 2004 killer earthquake and tsunami.
This time, it did not cause any tsunami, but the collapse of buildings caused the death of more than 100 people.
2018: The tourist island of Lombok (Indonesia) was hit by a series of earthquakes of great magnitude that killed more than 500 people, most of them on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake devastated thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily displaced.
Sarah Palin's son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the son of the former governor of Alaska and the vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested for charges of assault.
Palin, 29 years old and citizen of Wasilla (Alaska), was arrested under suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a report of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to the police report published by the Alaska State Police on Saturday.
According to said police report, when a known person tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took the phone away from her.
Palin has been charged with felony DUI and is being held in Mat-Su Pretrial Facility with a $500,000 cash bail, KTUU reports.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, where he declared “definitely innocent” when asked for his declaration, reported the channel.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, which means she could spend up to a year in prison and receive a fine of $250,000.
He has also been accused of a Class B misdemeanor, with a sentence of one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that Palin is charged with criminal charges.
In December 2017, she was accused of assaulting her father, Todd Palin.
Sarah Palin called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the court of veterans of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, interference in the filing of a domestic violence complaint, and possession of a firearm while intoxicated, in relation to the incident.
His girlfriend had said that she gave him a punch in the face.
Several veterans criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 for linking the violent behavior of her son to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) resulting from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of victims
At least 384 people died after a quake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake of a magnitude of 7.5 caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of houses.
The electricity and communication networks have fallen and it is expected that the number of deaths will increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred just next to the center of Sulawesi, which is located in the northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
There are several videos circulating on social networks that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami arrived at the coast.
Federal prosecutors seek death penalty for suspect in New York terror attack
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the terror attack in New York City that killed eight people, an exceptional punishment that has not been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out the October 31 attack on a bike path in the West Side of Manhattan, mowing down pedestrians and cyclists as he went.
To justify a death penalty, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed “intentionally” the eight victims and caused “intentionally” serious bodily injuries, according to the notice of intent to seek the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
The two charges carry a possible death penalty, according to the judicial document.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of murder in aid of a criminal enterprise, which federal prosecutors typically use in these cases, and a count of destruction of a motor vehicle.
The attack required “a substantial amount of planning and premeditation”, according to the prosecutors, who described the way Saipov carried it out as “atrocious, cruel and depraved”.
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damages and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco”, the warning states.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been a decade since the last time the Southern District of New York prosecuted a death penalty case.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of murdering two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a federal death penalty was carried out in a New York case was in 1953. Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed by the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, an immigrant from Uzbekistan, showed no remorse during the days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
According to the police, he said to the investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the accusation, Saipov told the authorities that for his attack he was inspired by watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also asked that the flag of ISIS be raised in his hospital room, said the police.
He has been declared not guilty of the 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they are “obviously disappointed” with the decision of the prosecution.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a guilty plea with a sentence of life without the possibility of parole, will prolong the trauma for all the people involved in these events,” said Patton.
The defense team for Saipov had previously requested that the prosecutors not seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel Farage should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to “mobilise the popular army” today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former leader of UKIP said that politicians had to “feel the heat” of Eurosceptics, while one of Theresa May’s MPs suggested he should be in charge of the Brexit negotiations.
The Conservative MP Peter Bone said in the Birmingham rally that the UK would have left the EU if Nigel Farage had been Secretary of Brexit.
But the challenge facing Theresa May to reconcile her divided party has been highlighted even more when a group of Tories in favour of staying in the EU joined a protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is fighting to keep the Chequers plan on its feet in the face of attacks from Brexit supporters, her opponents and the EU.
The allies insisted on trying to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the violent reaction, and will force the euro-sceptics and the Labour Party to choose between their package and chaos.
The MP Bone said at the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to reject the Chequers plan.
He suggested that Farage should have been given a post with responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he had been in charge, we would have already left”, he said.
This Member of Parliament for Wellingborough added: “I will defend Brexit, but we have to get rid of Chequers”.
In his declaration of opposition to the EU, he said: “We have not fought in world wars to be servile.”
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
He dismissed the suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 referendum: “The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is completely false”.
The Tory pro-Brexit Andrea Jenkyns was also at the rally, where she said to reporters: “Just one thing: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The general public does not like the Chequers plan, the opposition will not vote for it and it is not popular with our party and our activists, who are the ones who actually go out on the streets and vote for us first.
Forget about Chequers and start listening.
In a message directed to May, he added: The first ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.
Farage said to the concentrated that it would be necessary to “feel the heat” to the politicians if it was seen that they were going to betray the decision taken in the referendum of 2016.
“Now it’s a question of trust between us, the people, and our political class.”
“They are trying to betray Brexit and today we are here to tell them that they will not get away with it.”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class feel the heat.”
“We are mobilising the people’s army of this country that gave us victory with Brexit and we will never rest until we have become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom.”
While the supporters of the stay marched through the streets of Birmingham before the two-hour rally in the city centre.
Some activists waved placards against Tories Against Brexit after the presentation of the group this weekend.
The Labour MP Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives for the problems they had with an application for the party's conference.
“These are the same people who tell us that they can implement the systems and all the technology to implement Canada Plus Plus, for the border in harmony, for the free trade without borders in Ireland.”
“It’s a total farce.”
There is nothing that can be considered a good Brexit.
Warren considers all the possibilities of running for president
US Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will consider all possibilities after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future during a municipal meeting in the west of Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will run for reelection in November against Geoff Diehl, the Republican state representative, who was co-chairman of Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
There has been considerable speculation about the possibility that Warren will face Trump in 2020.
The afternoon event in Holyoke on Saturday was the 30th meeting with voters using the municipal format since Trump took office.
A secretary asked him if he was going to run for president.
Warren responded that it is time for women to go to Washington to fix our irregular government, and that includes having a woman at the top.
An arrest made in the murder of LSU football player Tyrann Mathieu
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced Saturday that a suspect has been arrested in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at a press conference at 11 a.m.
They had published a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help to identify a man who is seen in the video.
Sims, 20 years old, was shot to death near the campus of Southern University at first light Friday.
“Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head that ultimately led to his death,” said Police Chief Murphy J. Paul to the media on Saturday, for 247sports.
Wayde went to defend a friend and received a shot from Simpson.
During the interrogation, Simpson admitted to being at the scene of the crime, in possession of a weapon, and having shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and was detained in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 1.98m tall player from Baton Rouge, played in 32 games last season, starting 10 of them, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton closes in on the world title after his team handed him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Bottas qualified ahead of Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that the team orders would play a key role in the race.
From the pole, Bottas had a good start and almost threw Hamilton out of the race by defending his position in the first two laps and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to enter the boxes and let Hamilton run in the back of the group, something that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes car came out with a strong late move and was behind Vettel, but Hamilton overtook him after a move with the wheels almost touching that made Vettel have to let the inside free at risk of resisting after a double move to defend himself in the third corner.
Max Verstappen, who was 21 years old that day, started from the last row of the grid and finished in the seventh place at the end of the first race.
After leading a large part of the race while hanging on to his tyres to achieve a quick finish and beat Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
Finally, he entered the boxes in the 44th lap, but he could not increase his rhythm in the remaining eight laps after recovering Raikkonen the fourth position.
It was a difficult day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and was a true gentleman by letting me pass.
The team has done an exceptional job to get a perfect couple
That was a really bad body language
President Donald Trump mocked Sen. Dianne Feinstein at a rally Saturday for her insistence that she did not leak the letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in Virginia Western, the president did not directly mention the testimony offered by Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but he commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that there are people who are “bad, repulsive and false”.
“The only thing that could happen and the good thing that is happening these last days in the Senate, is when you see the anger, when you see people who are bad, repugnant and false.”
“When you read the publications and the leaks, and then they say “But if I didn’t do it.”
I didn’t do it.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak it?
Remember your answer... Did you filter the document? - "Oh, oh, ¿what?"
Oh, no.
I didn’t filter it.
Well, wait a minute.
Have we filtered...? No, we haven't filtered it”, he added while imitating the senator.
A Feinstein sent the letter to Kavanaugh in which the allegations against him were detailed in July and leaked in September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.
“I did not hide the allegations of Dr. Ford, I did not leak her story,” Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
“She asked me to keep it confidential and, therefore, I did.”
But his refusal did not seem to sit well with the president, who during his Saturday night rally commented as follows: “I’m going to tell you something: that was a really bad body language.”
Maybe he didn’t do it, but that’s the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing with his defense of the Supreme Court nominee, who has been accused of inappropriate sexual conduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the accusations for their own ends.
“They are determined to recover power by any means possible.”
You see the evil and the repugnance, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to step on to get power and control”, said the president according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against the Dundee
The Dundee Stars recovered the defeat on Friday in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants by winning the return match on Saturday by 5-3 in Dundee.
The Giants got an early lead thanks to the attacks of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied the game before Dwyer restored the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard equalized for Dundee before two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured their victory.
This was the third defeat in the Elite League for the men of Adam Keefe, who had won 2-1 against Dundee in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting between the two teams, of which the Giants won the three previous games.
The first goal of Dwyer came in the fourth minute (3:35) thanks to an assist from Kendall McFaull, while David Rutherford provided the assist for Beauvillier to double the lead four minutes later.
In what can be considered an initial very animated period, Sullivan returned to put the local team with the desire to play in the 13:10 before Matt Marquardt assisted Cownie to equalize the game in the 15:16.
Dwyer ensured that the Giants took the lead before the first break when he scored his second goal of the night at the end of the first half.
The local team regrouped and Bouchard once again equalized the game with a goal in the 27th minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the game in the second half and secured the victory with the fifth goal of his team as he approached the final whistle.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, play at home against Milton Keynes on Friday.
A traffic controller dies so that hundreds of people can escape the plane in the earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is being hailed as a hero after dying to ensure that a plane carrying hundreds of people could take off safely.
More than 800 people died and many are missing after a powerful earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi, triggering a tsunami.
The strong aftershocks continue to hit the area and many are trapped in the rubble in the city of Palu.
Despite his friends fleeing to save their lives, Anthonius Gunawan Agung, 21, refused to leave his post at the control tower of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu. The tower was being affected by a strong tremor.
He remained firm to ensure that the Batik Air flight 6321, which was on the runway at that moment, could take off safely.
After jumping from the traffic control tower, he thought it was collapsing.
He died later in the hospital.
The spokesperson of Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, reported the Australian ABC News channel.
We had prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take it to a bigger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
“Our hearts break when we hear this”, added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach several thousand. The national disaster mitigation agency says access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“It is believed that the number of victims will continue to increase, as there are still many bodies under the rubble and we have not been able to contact many people”, says Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the agency.
Some waves that reached up to six meters have devastated Palu, which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
The aid and supplies are being brought in by military and commercial aircraft.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance arrives with more bodies.”
Clean water is scarce.
The mini-markets are being looted in all places.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: “The Red Cross of Indonesia is trying to help as much as possible to the survivors, but we don’t know what they will find there
This is already a tragedy, but it could have been much worse.
The president of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the army of the country: “I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.”
Are you ready?
Indonesia had been hit by earthquakes in Lombok in the beginning of this year, which killed more than 550 people..
Air Niugini says a man is missing after an air accident in a lagoon
The airline, which operates a flight that crashed into a lagoon in Micronesia, now says that a man has disappeared, after saying that the 47 passengers and the crew had evacuated safely from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday evening it could not confirm the whereabouts of a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
The local boats were used to help rescue the other passengers and the crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at the Chuuk International Airport.
The authorities said on Friday that seven people had been transferred to a hospital..
The airline said six passengers were still in hospital and all were in a stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events are still not clear.
The airline and the US Navy said that the plane landed in the lagoon that is before the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had overshot the runway.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane arrived very low.
“That’s something extremely good”, said Jaynes.
Jaynes commented that he and other travelers were able to advance through water that reached their waists to the emergency exits of the plane that was beginning to sink.
He said that the passengers on board the plane were in panic and were screaming, and that he suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy said the sailors who were working on a nearby pier also helped in the rescue by using a small inflatable boat to transport people to shore before the plane sank about 30 meters (100 feet) below the water.
The data from the aviation security network in Papua New Guinea indicate that 111 people have died in accidents registered with airlines in Papua New Guinea in the last two decades, but none with Air Niugini.
An analyst presents the chronology of the night in which a woman was burned alive
The prosecution finished its arguments on Saturday in the new trial of a man accused of burning a woman to death in Mississippi in 2014.
The analyst of the Department of Justice of the U.S. Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used the phone records to tie the movements of Quinton Tellis, the accused, and Jessica Chambers, the victim, the night she died.
Rowlett said he received data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night of her death, contradicting his previous statements, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his mobile phone had been with Chambers's during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford climbed the stage on Saturday and testified that he had not been in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in the truck that night, Sanford said he was “lying, because my truck was in Nashville”.
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he had met Chambers approximately two weeks before his death.
The mobile phone records showed that they met only a week before.
Rowlett said that at some point after the death of Chambers, Tellis deleted the messages, calls and contact information of Chambers from his phone.
“He wiped out her life”, said Hale.
The defense has scheduled to begin its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be decided by the jury that day.
The High Breed: What is Conscious Hip Hop?
A hip hop trio wants to fill their music with positive messages to challenge the negative image of the genre.
The High Breed, from Bristol, says that hip hop has moved away from its original messages of political and social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Interpreters like The Fugees and Common have seen a recent resurgence in the UK thanks to artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
A New York nanny is suing a couple for firing her after she sent a racist text
A New York nanny is suing a couple for discrimination after receiving a text message from the mother complaining that she was “another black person”.
The couple denies being racist and compares the lawsuit with a case of “extortion”.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, expressed her consternation upon discovering that the new child care provider, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived for her first day of work in 2016.
“NOOOOOOOOOOO ANOTHER BLACK PERSON”, wrote the Sra. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Maurice twice.
After realizing her mistake, a “uncomfortable” Plasco-Flaxman fired her “terrible” black nanny and hired a Filipino one, according to the New York Post.
Maurice received the pay for a day's work and sent it home in Uber.
Maurice is now suing the couple for a compensation for the dismissal with the intention of receiving a compensation of 350 dollars a day for the six months of work for which he had been hired, although without a contract.
“I want to show them that things don’t happen like that”, he told The Post on Friday and added that “I know this is a case of discrimination.”
The couple responded to the allegations that they are racists by saying that the termination of Maurice's employment was the most reasonable, since they feared that they could not trust her after having offended her.
“My wife had sent him something he didn’t want to say.”
She is not racist.
We are not racists”, said the husband Joel Plasco to the Post.
“But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you have been rude to, even if it was by mistake?”
Do you have a newborn?
Come on!”
Comparing the demand as an extortion, Plasco said that his wife had given birth to a baby two months ago and that she was in a “very difficult situation”.
“Are you going to go for someone like that?”
That’s not a very decent thing”, he added.
Although the legal case is still pending, the public opinion court has given a quick response, criticizing the couple for their behavior and their logic.
The editors of Paddington feared that readers would not identify with a talking bear, reveals a new letter
The daughter of Bond, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the letter: “It was difficult to put yourself in the place of someone who was reading it for the first time before its publication.”
It is very funny to know now what we know about the great success of Paddington.
After saying that his father, who had worked as a BBC chambermaid before inspiring him to write the children’s book, trusted that his work would be rejected, he added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was “bittersweet” after his death last year.
From Paddington, who she describes as “a very important member of our family”, added that her father was very proud of her final success.
“He was a very quiet man and didn’t like to boast.”
“But as Paddington had been so real to him, it was almost as if you had a son who achieved something important: you are proud of him, though it is not really your achievement.”
I think he saw the success of Paddington in that way.
Although it was his creation and product of his imagination, he always gave credit to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to leave by phone
When the plane landed, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur Hospital 2 in Nice, where the doctors worked in vain to save her life.
“She was calling regularly to say that the situation was really bad, that she didn’t expect to succeed”, said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
“After I received the call from Nad to tell me she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.”
And so I did.
I told him: “Tashi, I love you very much, dear.”
I will be with you soon.
I will be with you.
The drugs that the doctors had given him to keep his heart pumping were running out and his system was being depleted.
She had died before her time and everything was dying.
I was able to sit there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn't scream, I couldn't cry, I couldn't even make a sound because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to keep myself firm.
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now suffering from the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, unaware of the terrible experience she was going through.
“Nobody knew that”, he said.
“I bent my head and the tears were falling all the time.”
It's hard to explain, but I felt this overwhelming sense of sympathy for Nad on the flight.
What I needed was all my love and understanding.
He knew how much I loved him.
Women in mourning put cards to avoid suicides is a bridge
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide are working to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been putting cards on a bridge in Wales with inspirational messages and phone numbers to call if people need help.
Tyler, the son of Mrs. Davis, had 13 years when he began to suffer depression and committed suicide at 18 years.
“I don’t want any father to feel what I feel every day”, he said.
Davis, 45 years old and living in Lydney, said that his son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him by his smile.”
They always said that her smile lit up any place.
However, he left his job before dying, because he was “in a really dark place”.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, found him after having taken his own life.
Mrs. Davis said: “I worry constantly about the consequences.”
Davis created the cards “so that people know there are people to whom you can go and talk, even if it’s a friend.
Don’t sit in silence, you have to talk about it.
Mrs. Humphreys, who is a friend of Davies for years, lost her partner Mark, with whom she had been living for 15 years, shortly after the death of her mother.
“He didn’t say he was depressed or anything like that,” he tells us.
“Two days before Christmas we noticed a change in his attitude.”
The day of Christmas came to its lowest point: when the children opened their gifts, he didn’t even look at them.
He said that his death was a great trauma for them, but they have to get over it: “He left a void in the whole family.
He has left us in ruins.
But we all have to keep fighting.

The future of Brett Kavanaugh hangs by a thread as the FBI begins its investigation
“I thought if we could actually get something like what he was asking for (a limited investigation, of limited scope), maybe we could bring a little unity,”
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican partisans not want the FBI investigation to take place?
His refusal is entirely due to the chronology.
There are only five weeks left until the midterm elections, November 6. If, as expected, the Republicans have a bad result, their attempts to elect the man they want for the highest court in the country will be severely weakened.
George W. Bush has been calling senators, pressuring them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for him in the White House. Thanks to Bush, Kavanaugh met his wife Ashley, who was the personal secretary to the President.
What happens once the FBI publishes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear if Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie and confirm him for the Supreme Court.
The numbers of desertors from North Korea “fall” with Kim
The number of deserters from North Korea to South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Ministry of Unification, said that last year there were 1,127 desertions, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Park said that the strict border controls between North Korea and China, and the high tariffs that the traffickers of people have been the key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments on the matter.
Most of the deserters from the north are finally offered citizenship in the south.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers that the deserters are illegal immigrants instead of refugees and, often, are repatriated.
The relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have improved considerably in the last months.
At the beginning of May, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to have talks that focused on the negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This happened after the historic meeting in June between the US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, which agreed in general terms to work for a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.
But the Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea, Ri Yong-ho, blamed the lack of progress on the sanctions imposed by the United States.
“Without the confidence of the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, under these circumstances, we will not be the first to disarm unilaterally,” Ri said in a speech before the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh “histrionic” and says he is not fit to serve on the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, the minority leader of the House of Representatives, said that the nominee to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh was a “histrionic” and was not fit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin (Texas).
“I can’t stop thinking that if a woman had acted that way, they would have said she’s hysterical,” Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh served the emotion to deny the accusations of having sexually assaulted the doctor Christine Blasey Ford when they were adolescents.
During his initial declaration, Kavanaugh was very emotional, at times almost shouting and choking while speaking of his family and his years of secondary education.
In the committee, he also condemned explicitly the Democrats, calling their accusations against him “grotesque and clearly coordinated” attacks organized by some liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that, in her opinion, the testimony of Kavanaugh proved that this could not serve in the Supreme Court, because it showed his partiality against Democrats.
I think he’s disqualifying himself with those statements and the way he’s pursued the Clintons and Democrats.
Pelosi objected when asked if she would oppose Kavanaugh if he were confirmed in the case and if the Democrats were to gain a majority in the House.
“I will say only one thing: if he is not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, he will not be fit to be on the Supreme Court, and he will not be fit to be on the court he is on now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about the possible sentences of Kavanaugh against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case, which is considered to be a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided answering questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
“This is not the time for an hysterical and impartial person to go to court and expect us to think that everything is fine,” said Pelosi.
And women have to take it up.
It's a justified diatribe, it's months and years of fury overflowing, and she can't let it go without crying.
“We cry when we are angry”, said Mrs. Steinem 45 years ago.
“I don’t think that’s so strange, do you?”
She continued talking: “She helped me a lot, a woman who was an executive in some company and told me that she also cried when she was angry, but that she had developed a technique by which when she was angry and began to cry, she told the person she was talking to: “Maybe you think I’m crying because I’m sad.”
No, I’m not angry.
And then I continued with what I was doing.
I thought it was great.
The tears are allowed as a way out for the anger in part because basically they are not understood well.
One of the clearest memories I have of one of my first jobs, in a male-dominated office, was when I found myself crying with an unexpressed rage. An older woman, a serious manager I had always been a little afraid of, grabbed me by the neck and dragged me up a flight of stairs.
“Never let them see you cry”, he said.
“They don’t even know you’re angry.”
They think you are sad and will be happy because they think they have cornered you.
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Hart was caught in an extramarital affair on board the Monkey Business, a yacht, and had to retire from the presidential race, Schroeder, deeply frustrated, came up with the idea of running for president herself.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision”, he said to me with a laugh 30 years later.
“There were already seven candidates in the race and they didn’t need another one.”
Someone referred to us as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs”.
As the campaign was already well advanced, he stayed behind in the fundraising, so he promised that he would not run again unless he raised two million dollars.
It was a lost battle.
He discovered that some of his supporters who gave $1,000 to the men, gave her only $250.
“Do they think I have a discount?”, he wondered.
When she announced that she would not have a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions (gratitude for the people who had supported her, frustration with the system that made it difficult to raise funds and that focused on capturing voters instead of delegates, and anger at the sexism), that she choked.
“It would have been logical to think that he had had a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder said, recalling the reaction of the press.
“You could have thought that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.”
I remember thinking, what are they going to put on my tombstone?
“Did she cry?”
The trade war between the United States and China could benefit Beijing
The first salvos of the trade war between the United States and China were deafening, and although there is still a long way to go for the battle to end, a rupture between the countries could benefit Beijing, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, launched the first warning at the beginning of the year by putting tariffs on the main Chinese exports, such as solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant climb occurred this week with new tariffs that affect 200 billion dollars (150 billion pounds sterling) in products, which will tax half of the products that enter the United States from China.
In all cases, Beijing has taken retaliatory measures, applying tariffs of five to ten percent to U.S. products worth $60 billion.
China has committed to equal attacks by the U.S., and it is unlikely that the second largest economy in the world will soon relax.
To retreat would mean to give in to Washington’s demands, but to submit to the United States would be too humiliating for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Even so, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressures of the trade war between the United States and China could help China in the long run by reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a quick decision in Washington or Beijing could make the conditions for a sudden collapse of the economy in either country is in fact much more dangerous than what the spectators have recognized so far,” said Abigail Grace, associate fellow at the Center for New American Security.
Syria is ready to receive refugees, says the foreign minister
Syria says it is ready to receive refugees and calls for help to rebuild a country devastated by a war that has lasted more than seven years.
In a speech before the General Assembly of the United Nations, the Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem said that the conditions of the country were improving.
The situation on the ground is today more stable and safer thanks to the progress that has been made in the fight against terrorism.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists in order to try to restore normality.
All the conditions are in place for the voluntary return of refugees who had to leave their country due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and their means of living.
The UN estimates that, since the beginning of the war in 2011, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country.
There are still six million people in the country who need humanitarian aid.
The Syrian regime has acknowledged that it would welcome help to rebuild the country.
But he also emphasized that he would not accept conditional aid or the aid of the countries that promoted the insurgency.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team has won the Ryder Cup of 2018 by defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National, outside Paris (France).
The United States has now suffered six consecutive defeats on European soil since its last victory in the Ryder Cup in 1993.
Europe recovered the crown when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team won 14.5 points to beat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had to fight hard during the whole tournament, launched his ball into the water on the 16th hole, admitting his defeat to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Francesco Molinari highlighted in all his rounds, becoming one of the four players who have never achieved a 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
Jordan Spieth, the American, lost to the lowest-ranked player on the European team, the Dane Thorbjorn Olesen, 5 and 4.
The world number one, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to the Englishman Ian Poulter, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
The Spanish Sergio García, a veteran who has already won eight Ryder Cups, became the European with the most victories in the history of the tournament, with 25.5 points in his career.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t stop today.”
It has been a very hard year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I am very, very happy to have been able to recover the cup.
It is a success of the whole team and I am very happy to have been able to help”, said an emotional García after the victory of the European team.
Now it's the turn of his compatriot John Rahm, who already defeated the legend of American golf Tiger Woods by 2 and 1 in a singles match.
“I feel an incredible pride to have beaten Tiger Woods, because I grew up watching this man,” said the golfer of 23 years John Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in his career of the Ryder Cup.
This is a strange statistic for one of the best players of all time, who has won 14 major titles, leaving only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The United States team had to fight all weekend to find the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played great golf throughout the tournament.
Captain of the United States, Jim Furyk, spoke after the disappointing performance of his team: “I am very proud of these guys, they never stopped fighting.”
There was a moment this morning when we heated up the situation in Europe.
But we ruined it.
I want to congratulate Thomas.
He is a great captain.
His 12 players have played a very good game.
We will regroup, I will meet with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we will move forward.
I love these 12 boys and I'm proud to be their captain.
Now it's our turn to bow our heads.
They have surpassed us.
